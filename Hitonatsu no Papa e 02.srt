1
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:06,430
I'm late!

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,400
EVICTION NOTICE:
PLEASE LEAVE BY JULY 31ST.

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,670
I don't believe this.

4
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:16,110
This isn't good.

5
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:18,880
I'm late from the first day.

6
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,190
I don't believe this.

7
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:37,500
<i>The guy I liked a year
ago was there.</i>

8
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,700
Marimo.

9
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,000
Are you taking summer
lectures, too?

10
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:50,010
I want to go to the same
college as Rintarô.

11
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:52,610
See you later.

12
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,050
Bye.

13
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:01,190
Is that right?

14
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,500
I have to go to the
registration office.

15
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:11,460
We haven't received it yet.

16
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:13,610
I don't believe this...

17
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:15,304
There's been no payment?

18
00:01:15,304 --> 00:01:17,770
We received you application
for it, but we haven't

19
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:18,970
received payment for it.

20
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:24,100
So you can't attend
the lecture today.

21
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:25,840
Please submit
payment immediately.

22
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,000
Yes.

23
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:35,290
Julianne, it's time to eat.

24
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:46,660
So the payment wasn't made...

25
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:51,500
<i>I woke up late...</i>

26
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,640
<i>and rushed all the way here.</i>

27
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,310
<i>But I couldn't attend class.</i>

28
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:01,280
<i>Rintarô-senpai is
dating Satsuki.</i>

29
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:05,080
<i>And there was that
eviction notice on my door.</i>

30
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,190
<i>This is a bad day for me.</i>

31
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:16,360
Aren't you going
to attend your lecture?

32
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:19,200
I'm in trouble.

33
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,930
What's wrong?

34
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,900
I've fallen for you.

35
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,060
<i>I don't believe this!</i>

36
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:57,140
<i>This is the start of a
confusing summer break.</i>

This isn't good, after all...

54
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,800
Let's take a break
until show time!

55
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:18,780
Sotokoba-san, this
is about my friend...

56
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:23,280
She was kissed by her
friend's boyfriend.

57
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:26,010
What do you think
of that?

58
00:05:26,013 --> 00:05:27,450
What do you mean?

59
00:05:27,457 --> 00:05:30,220
Should she tell her
friend about it?

60
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,920
That's a difficult one.

61
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,990
Why should she?

62
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:39,700
What? Wouldn't you
normally do that?

63
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:41,950
Does she tell her friend?

64
00:05:41,956 --> 00:05:44,630
- That's not a good idea.
- It's not?

65
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:47,770
It'll only hurt her friend.

66
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:51,640
What if she accuses her
of seducing him?

67
00:05:57,010 --> 00:06:00,320
I think the problem lies
in how that girl, who was

68
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,820
kissed, feels about him.

69
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:05,020
That's true.

70
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:08,830
You're smart. I guess
wisdom comes with age.

71
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:14,030
Does your friend
like that guy?

72
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:20,400
A little.

73
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:23,980
That's complicated!

74
00:06:23,986 --> 00:06:25,740
It's a love triangle!

75
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:35,860
So does she tell her
friend or not?

76
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:38,020
Shinpei is good at
those things.

77
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:40,960
Shinpei's good at it.

78
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:44,890
Never mind him.

79
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:52,900
Should we have left
him to Shinpei?

80
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,840
Will you calm down a bit?

81
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,310
How can I?

82
00:06:58,110 --> 00:06:59,860
Our fate lies on it.

83
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:03,380
We left our key witness to an
important case to Shinpei.

84
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:06,020
How can I remain calm?

85
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,280
Don't yell at me.

86
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:11,300
Do you want to know
what the case is about?

87
00:07:11,303 --> 00:07:13,990
- No.
- I'll tell you.

88
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:19,430
"A" who borrowed money
from the loanshark,

89
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:21,660
committed suicide a year ago.

90
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:27,740
"B" who is that man's son,
blames the collectors' harsh

91
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:29,810
methods for his father's death.

92
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:36,150
He stabbed the man in
charge of the collections.

93
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:40,450
Then the loanshark reported
him for attempted murder.

94
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:44,250
We'll be defending
"B" in this case.

95
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,760
The date of the trail
is coming up.

96
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,930
And we're having this man,
Ebihara Masaru, who worked

97
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:53,760
for that loanshark company
part-time, stand as witness.

98
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,230
Did he turn them in?

99
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,370
We want to expose their
harsh collection methods

100
00:07:58,370 --> 00:07:59,900
with Ebihara's testimony.

101
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,570
We'll ask the court
to take the extenuating

102
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:03,140
circumstances
into consideration.

103
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:05,940
We'll show the media our abilities
and increase our clientele.

104
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:08,400
- That's the game plan.
- Wow.

105
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,510
There's a problem though.

106
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:16,790
There's a bunch that can't
afford to have him testify.

107
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:18,870
And rumor has it that
they are after his life.

108
00:08:18,877 --> 00:08:20,450
Killers?

109
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:26,260
Shinpei has him in his custody
until the day of the trail.

110
00:08:26,630 --> 00:08:28,220
He's the bodyguard?

111
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:29,470
Shinpei is groovy.

112
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:31,240
What's so groovy about him?

113
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,970
I'm completely worried!

114
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:35,540
Do you think that
unshaved good-for-nothing

115
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:37,670
can handle a major
job like this?

116
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,800
- Satoi.
- Yes?

117
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:47,220
It all starts with trust.

118
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:55,260
But Shinpei is...

119
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:09,970
I'm here with the <i>bentô</i>.

120
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:12,510
Leave them there.

121
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:16,210
So you're being a filial
daughter to him.

122
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:18,350
She's just doing her job.

123
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:25,790
Dr. Asami, you must be
in a fix to find out that

124
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:27,340
Shinpei has a child.

125
00:09:27,346 --> 00:09:30,630
- Why is that?
- Are you acting tough?

126
00:09:30,633 --> 00:09:32,730
Oh, is that how you're
going to come out?

127
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,940
This is the first time
we're formally meeting.

128
00:09:35,946 --> 00:09:37,900
Hello.

129
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:54,520
Let's eat!

130
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,690
Eh, bad news!
Go back and work!

131
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:03,660
What a way to talk to her.

132
00:10:04,390 --> 00:10:06,260
There's no loving feeling.

133
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:09,400
You have to be kind to her.

134
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:13,170
She shouldn't be seeing
something like this.

135
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,300
Is that so?

136
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:18,100
Is that your comeback?

137
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:20,390
- I want to talk to you.
- No.

138
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:22,450
Let's play again.

139
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,210
I want child support.

140
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,227
What?

141
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:30,590
I won't collect for the
past, so can you start

142
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:32,330
paying me from this month?

143
00:10:32,339 --> 00:10:35,500
You've got it wrong there.

144
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,600
Stop kidding around.

145
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,100
I'm serious.

146
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,910
Child support?

147
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:45,940
If you can afford to bet
10,000 or 20,000 yen on

148
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:47,800
mahjong, can you
give it to me instead?

149
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,810
You show up all of a sudden
and claim to be my daughter.

150
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:57,120
Then you tell me your mama
died and you want child support.

151
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,150
Did you honestly think
I'd readily agree to it?

152
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,090
Do I look like
Daddy Long Legs?

153
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:03,220
You're my father.

154
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:05,220
- Who do you think you are?
- Your daughter.

155
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:07,160
So you're going
to come on strong?

156
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,850
This is my entire fortune.

157
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:34,480
Take it.

158
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:45,030
- Are you going to take it?
- You said to take it.

159
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:47,560
- That's all that I have!
- But you said to take it!

160
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:50,570
- Are you a demon?
- Don't accuse me of that.

161
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:53,070
- What are you thinking of?
- I want it!

162
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:56,050
- Stop being money crazy!
- I want to attend prep school.

163
00:11:56,054 --> 00:11:57,670
And I want to move houses!

164
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:00,180
But I don't have any money.

165
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:11,250
All right!

166
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:17,160
Wait until I complete
this job.

167
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:39,780
Good luck with work...

168
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:41,450
...and at being a papa.

169
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:43,520
See you later.

170
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,070
Sorry to tease you earlier.

171
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,340
It's all right.

172
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:05,686
Take it. You deserve
to have it.

173
00:13:05,686 --> 00:13:08,110
He ignored you until now.

174
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:13,750
Put it away before your
dad gets back.

175
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:27,230
Trouble!

176
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:28,770
Trouble?

177
00:13:28,776 --> 00:13:30,200
They're going to kill me.

178
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,750
You're going to get killed?

179
00:13:31,756 --> 00:13:33,400
I'm definitely going
to get killed!

180
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:40,140
- What's up?
- They're here!

181
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,850
- They're going to kill me!
- Let's go up!

182
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:49,350
- Where are we going?
- Hide there.

183
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,390
Hurry!

184
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,260
We're safe here.

185
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:01,760
They don't know
about this place.

186
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:04,630
What a scare!

187
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,440
Don't worry.

188
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:12,530
- Say...
- What?

189
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:15,780
Is there a reason why
I had to run away?

190
00:14:17,510 --> 00:14:22,320
It doesn't concern me,
does it?

191
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:28,690
Yes, it doesn't.

192
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:36,660
I can't stand this.
Why are you at my home?

193
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:39,440
We have nowhere else to go.

194
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:43,247
This is the only place
I could think of.

195
00:14:43,247 --> 00:14:45,740
What's wrong?

196
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,950
You have a point.

197
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:07,190
Let's go.

198
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:09,640
Where? I don't want
to move from here.

199
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:12,040
- Just come!
- What if I get killed?

200
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:18,040
I'll protect you,
even if I die.

201
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:28,080
If you get killed,
you can't protect me.

202
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:31,350
Stop getting smart!

203
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:43,000
You can stay here today.

204
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:49,513
Shinpei disappeared?

205
00:15:49,513 --> 00:15:51,410
When I went to check up
on him at his room,

206
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:52,910
his place was ransacked.

207
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:54,500
Is Ebihara missing, too?

208
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,180
Yes. They were most
likely taken away.

209
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:03,490
Can't he even do a
babysitting job properly!?

210
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:07,990
Who are you men?

211
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,660
Are you Konari-san?

212
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:14,530
I'm asking you who you are!

213
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:16,870
Shut up, small fry!

214
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:20,100
Have a seat.

215
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:33,380
Let's strike a deal.

216
00:16:35,690 --> 00:16:38,990
Will you hand over Ebihara?

217
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,830
My boss is willing
to pay 100 million yen.

218
00:16:43,837 --> 00:16:45,830
It's not a bad deal, is it?

219
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,540
Let me think about it.

220
00:16:57,170 --> 00:17:00,440
We'll be waiting
for a good response.

221
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:10,890
What's going on?

222
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:25,170
Shinpei hasn't been caught.
He's doing his job.

223
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,340
A 100 million yen, huh.

224
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:32,910
This is getting to be
interesting.

225
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:01,870
Shinpei isn't here.

226
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:04,130
Is that right?

227
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,770
Dr. Asami, aren't you...

228
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:10,340
What is it?

229
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,050
Isn't he here?

230
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,380
I wanted to talk to him.

231
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:25,360
I thought he'd know how
it is as a new father.

232
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:33,860
My daughter gets
violent in the home.

233
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:35,300
She's at a defiant age.

234
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,370
She doesn't even tell us
when she leaves the house.

235
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:39,640
So I have to chase after
her and scold her for it.

236
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:45,240
Manager!

237
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,850
Why won't you talk to me?

238
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:04,090
This is scary.

239
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,900
EVICTION NOTICE

240
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:11,200
Hey!

241
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,170
Isn't it dangerous to be
out here during the day?

242
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:17,070
It's easier to get lost
in the crowd.

243
00:20:17,070 --> 00:20:19,930
I get your point.

244
00:20:19,933 --> 00:20:21,630
You needn't tag along.

245
00:20:21,633 --> 00:20:23,910
I don't want to be
home all alone.

246
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:25,710
Go somewhere else.

247
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:27,856
Like prep school.

248
00:20:27,856 --> 00:20:29,926
I need money for it.

249
00:20:29,926 --> 00:20:32,350
I can't attend classes
until I pay the tuition.

250
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:39,460
I'm hungry.

251
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:41,730
Let's grab something to eat.

252
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:44,090
Sure.

253
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,400
- Money.
- I have none.

254
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,870
What happened
to the money?

255
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:50,670
<i>I don't have it.
I left it at your place.</i>

256
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:56,740
Don't just leave it.
Why didn't you bring it?

257
00:20:57,170 --> 00:20:59,880
You're so stupid.

258
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:02,810
How are we going to eat?

259
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,660
Let's go mug someone.

260
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:17,660
That's young.

261
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,200
That's all I can think of.

262
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:23,730
That's true.

263
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:26,274
OK.

264
00:21:26,274 --> 00:21:28,100
Don't agree to it.

265
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:32,340
We're in the midst of
a battle now.

266
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:35,610
We can't go to battle
on an empty stomach.

267
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:37,350
How old are you?

268
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:39,480
I'm 38.

269
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,750
I found a perfect victim!

270
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,090
Stop it!

271
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:46,560
Give me 10,000 yen!
Or 5,000 yen!

272
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,320
Even 3,000 yen will do!

273
00:21:48,323 --> 00:21:49,760
Don't pick on me.

274
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:53,300
Koba-san?

275
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:55,570
What's going on here?

276
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,500
<i>Audition?</i>

277
00:22:02,213 --> 00:22:03,910
It's for a musical.

278
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:07,150
Is that right?
That's awesome!

279
00:22:07,153 --> 00:22:08,760
It's my dream.

280
00:22:08,763 --> 00:22:11,930
- That's great!
- Fantastic!

281
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:14,120
I have to get the part first.

282
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:18,390
We're starting the audition
for numbers 30 through 40!

283
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:19,990
I'm going.

284
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,580
When I see people talking
about their dreams,

285
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:40,210
it makes me upset.

286
00:22:46,450 --> 00:22:48,990
I used to be a dancer.

287
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:56,830
You?

288
00:22:57,530 --> 00:22:59,460
What're you laughing about?

289
00:23:03,930 --> 00:23:07,000
But once you hurt
yourself, that's it.

290
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:09,570
It's unsightly.

291
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:13,880
Your Achilles' tendon?

292
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:18,450
I started dancing from
when I was in middle school.

293
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,800
It was my dream to dance in major
stage productions and in New York City.

294
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,900
But it ended with a snap.

295
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:31,800
I can never forget
that snapping sound.

296
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:38,340
It was telling me
to give up on my dream.

297
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:45,880
After that, I went reckless.

298
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:50,850
That's how I ended up
at that place.

299
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:54,380
The loanshark company?

300
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:58,660
I picked on the weak...

301
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:01,320
and acted like the big guy.

302
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:05,860
I started wondering
what I was doing.

303
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:11,030
What is my life all about?

304
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:15,570
Don't get jealous of others.

305
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:19,480
I know.

306
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:28,820
I know!

307
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:30,970
What is it?

308
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:32,590
I have a good idea.

309
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,370
The rhythm for the audition.

310
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:48,810
I was nervous.

311
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:53,440
I'm sure you did fine.

312
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,550
- Think so?
- You danced well.

313
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:59,080
Thanks for saying that.

314
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:04,650
It's hard to realize
your dreams.

315
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:11,530
That's probably why you
can strive very hard.

316
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,570
Do you have a dream?

317
00:25:25,810 --> 00:25:27,980
My dream...

318
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:32,550
Marimo!

319
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:36,850
They're my friends.
I'm going over to talk to them.

320
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:40,460
Sorry.

321
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:43,730
As for prep school...

322
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:46,330
Is that your papa?

323
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:50,030
He doesn't look
sharp at all.

324
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,970
Is he really a private eye?

325
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:54,970
No, he's...

326
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:57,640
Rintarô!

327
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:03,550
Did you wait long?

328
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:04,850
No.

329
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:08,620
- See you later.
- Bye!

330
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:16,760
Did you hear about Satsuki?

331
00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:20,500
She's trying hard to get
into the same college as him.

332
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:32,940
Did you know?

333
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:35,250
Marimo went out to make
a delivery yesterday and

334
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:36,610
she never came back.

335
00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:38,750
Is that right?

336
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:43,050
She probably thinks the
hourly pay here it too low.

337
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:47,390
Will you consider raising
my hourly rate first?

338
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:49,890
Manager!

339
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,780
What happened to you?

340
00:26:53,786 --> 00:26:56,070
I'm sorry. I got caught
up with things.

341
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:57,700
You're getting a hourly
wage reduction.

342
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,270
I'll raise it by 50 yen!

343
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,470
Why are you with
Sotokoba-san?

344
00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:05,340
Are you two seeing
each other?

345
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:07,710
Are you really?

346
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:11,210
She went to the audition
with me to give me support.

347
00:27:11,213 --> 00:27:12,850
Sotokoba-san was great.

348
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:15,790
Audition? What do you mean?

349
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:18,690
It's for this!

350
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:22,130
- A musical!
- So you went to take it?

351
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:24,590
That's awesome.

352
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:28,930
- Where is he?
- Who?

353
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:33,820
Where were you? I was
looking all over for you.

354
00:27:33,823 --> 00:27:35,286
I was busy.

355
00:27:35,286 --> 00:27:36,970
Will you watch him dance?

356
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,200
Who is he?

357
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,900
My friend.

358
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:43,150
His name is Ebihara.

359
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,920
Nice to meet you!

360
00:28:22,550 --> 00:28:24,690
He's good.

361
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:02,160
That's it!

362
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:08,800
You're pretty good.

363
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,340
It was easy to dance
with him.

364
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:13,070
It was fun.

365
00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:18,880
Did you get your
child support?

366
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,380
Not yet.

367
00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:22,650
He's hopeless.

368
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:27,650
Aren't the people
here nice?

369
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:32,060
They give me energy.

370
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,600
Are you seeing him?

371
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:43,800
What does it seem like?

372
00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:46,040
I'm asking you.

373
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:49,540
It's hard to say.

374
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:56,250
Can I ask you something?

375
00:29:57,010 --> 00:29:58,793
What is it?

376
00:29:58,793 --> 00:30:00,680
It's about my friend.

377
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:05,050
She was kissed by her
friend's boyfriend.

378
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:09,360
It's a love triangle...
and it's complex.

379
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:13,030
Should she tell her
friend about it?

380
00:30:16,670 --> 00:30:18,800
Hello?

381
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:24,350
Shinpei! Where are you?
Is Ebihara safe?

382
00:30:24,357 --> 00:30:26,240
The trail is tomorrow!

383
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:28,760
That's a lot of questions.

384
00:30:28,763 --> 00:30:30,353
Answer me!

385
00:30:30,353 --> 00:30:31,750
Is Ebihara safe?

386
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:36,350
He's as safe as he can be.
Will you chill down?

387
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:40,490
Ebihara said to tell you
to deposit the money.

388
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:42,300
What is he talking about?

389
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:44,730
We promised to pay him
an appreciation fee

390
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:46,700
on the day before the trail.

391
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:50,000
Make sure you deposit
that by today.

392
00:30:50,670 --> 00:30:52,640
I'll be sure to take him
to the courtroom at

393
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,190
10:00 sharp tomorrow.

394
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:56,440
<i>Don't screw up now!</i>

395
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:09,020
What's wrong?

396
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:10,850
This...

397
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:15,190
Tomorrow?

398
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,360
Shinpei!

399
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:21,130
Will you look at this?

400
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:25,000
It's to the Philippines.

401
00:31:25,770 --> 00:31:27,960
It's for the 10:00 am
fight tomorrow.

402
00:31:27,967 --> 00:31:29,970
Isn't he going to dance
here with us?

403
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:33,720
Stop touching my stuff.

404
00:31:33,724 --> 00:31:35,310
What's the meaning of this?

405
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,410
Tomorrow is the day
of the trail.

406
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:41,750
You weren't planning
to show up?

407
00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:46,090
How can I make
a testimony like that?

408
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,560
They're very dangerous.

409
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:52,900
Did you deceive me?

410
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:01,700
Ebihara!

411
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,190
Did you swindle money
from Konari-san,

412
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:17,850
just to raise money
to flee the country?

413
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:25,490
What are you afraid
of at this point?

414
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:27,730
Shut up.

415
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:30,600
Shut up!

416
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:36,370
Ebihara!

417
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:41,680
Why do you deceive people?

418
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,950
Ebihara!

419
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,890
Get a grip! He ran away?

420
00:33:28,390 --> 00:33:30,590
We already deposited the
money into his account.

421
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,083
Are you in cahoots with him?

422
00:33:33,083 --> 00:33:34,560
Are you kidding?

423
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,700
I'm very sorry!

424
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:43,270
I promise to bring him back!

425
00:33:44,770 --> 00:33:48,410
Please tell me the address
of the company he worked for.

426
00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:51,840
Stupid. They're yakuza.

427
00:33:52,210 --> 00:33:54,650
Do you honestly think you
can get him back alone?

428
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:56,250
Will you shut up!

429
00:33:57,980 --> 00:33:59,480
Konari-san!

430
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:11,930
If you go, you'll get killed.

431
00:34:16,170 --> 00:34:17,570
I'll go.

432
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:20,240
It's my job.

433
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:32,020
What are you thinking of?
Don't be reckless.

434
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:34,890
- Get off my case, stupid.
- You're going to get killed!

435
00:34:34,890 --> 00:34:36,490
Stop following me.

436
00:34:36,490 --> 00:34:41,730
He deceived you! Why should
you have to go to save him?

437
00:34:42,930 --> 00:34:44,430
Marimo!

438
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:56,170
I promised him I'd
protect him even if I die.

439
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:03,850
<i>I'll protect you,
even if I die.</i>

440
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:11,390
I have to keep my promises.

441
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:14,960
But...

442
00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:19,300
Besides, I will get
paid for it.

443
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:23,470
Are you stupid?

444
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:27,570
I'll be sure to send
you to prep school.

445
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,380
Just wait for me.

446
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:49,190
What are you doing?

447
00:35:58,570 --> 00:36:00,370
Don't you have a gun?

448
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,580
Do you mean this?

449
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:08,680
Yes, this!

450
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:16,120
Not a real one! A fake!

451
00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:28,130
Hey! When are you
going there again?

452
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,620
You've got guts, Ebihara.

453
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:52,360
We knew that you weren't
planning to testify.

454
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:56,547
If we get prosecuted,
so will you.

455
00:36:56,547 --> 00:37:00,230
You're not one who can
live such a courageous life.

456
00:37:01,730 --> 00:37:05,740
Give us back the floppy disk
with the clients' addresses.

457
00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:13,280
Give us back the money
source data that you stole!

458
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:21,220
I don't want to corner people
to their deaths anymore.

459
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:25,283
I don't want to see
that happen again!

460
00:37:25,283 --> 00:37:26,790
Get real!

461
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:30,290
When did you turn into
a righteous guy!?

462
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:32,560
Are we wrong?

463
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:35,900
It's the people who don't pay
back their loans that are at fault!

464
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:37,740
Am I wrong about that?

465
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:41,040
Hey!

466
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:44,370
- Who are you?
- Ebihara's partner.

467
00:37:44,370 --> 00:37:46,180
Are you OK?

468
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:49,404
Are you the fools that's
been sheltering him?

469
00:37:49,404 --> 00:37:51,250
Don't move!

470
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:55,500
Koba-san.

471
00:37:58,890 --> 00:38:00,490
Put that on!

472
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,600
Put your hands up!

473
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:09,100
Koba-san.

474
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:14,210
Hurry!

475
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,910
Light each other's
candles!

476
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:22,210
Hurry!

477
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:25,550
Put your hands up!

478
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:27,680
Put them down!

479
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,520
Up, again! To the side!

480
00:38:32,290 --> 00:38:33,990
Don't move!

481
00:38:34,330 --> 00:38:36,130
Stay still!

482
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,200
Ebihara, come this side.

483
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,600
Koba-san.

484
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:47,640
Are you OK?

485
00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:50,200
You're late.

486
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,400
Shinpei!

487
00:38:53,450 --> 00:38:54,780
Ouch!

488
00:38:59,850 --> 00:39:03,790
Bam! Bam! Bam!

489
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:09,060
How dare you take
us for fools!

490
00:39:11,030 --> 00:39:13,360
I'm going to get you!

491
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:16,470
Will you chill down?

492
00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:19,100
Let's talk this over.

493
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:38,190
I'm sorry.

494
00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:42,700
Is that your occupation?

495
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:44,500
You're great!

496
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:49,500
SHIBAURA CLINIC

497
00:39:52,330 --> 00:39:54,070
Ouch!

498
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,640
Aren't you going
to use anesthesia?

499
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:58,510
- No.
- Why not?

500
00:39:58,510 --> 00:39:59,880
It's a waste.

501
00:40:00,610 --> 00:40:02,240
I don't believe this.

502
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:04,310
Will you pay me?

503
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,710
Sorry.

504
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:15,040
What are you doing?

505
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,690
Is this where he hid it?

506
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:21,400
It's an inconvenience.

507
00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:24,600
He must've had faith.

508
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:29,300
Thank you.

509
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:32,440
Say...

510
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:34,010
What?

511
00:40:34,010 --> 00:40:35,680
Is he your friend?

512
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,680
Yes.

513
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:39,110
When he deceived you?

514
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:43,350
I want to associate with
him for life, so he is.

515
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,320
See you.

516
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:56,730
A friend...

517
00:40:59,570 --> 00:41:01,500
The floppy diskette.

518
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,740
Shinpei did a good job.

519
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:08,800
COURTHOUSE

520
00:41:11,550 --> 00:41:13,080
What took you so long?

521
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:15,450
- Oh, he's hurt.
- Hurry!

522
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:18,240
You call yourself a
bodyguard, making him hurt?

523
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,690
And you're late.

524
00:41:19,690 --> 00:41:22,190
Come 30 minutes
early next time.

525
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,290
Let's grab a drink later.

526
00:41:24,290 --> 00:41:25,660
Are you listening?

527
00:41:25,660 --> 00:41:27,600
We don't have time. Hurry.

528
00:41:32,330 --> 00:41:36,440
Even if I get arrested,

529
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:39,370
you'll be my friend,
won't you?

530
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:46,820
I sure wish I could've
danced more!

531
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:49,490
See you later.

532
00:42:05,730 --> 00:42:08,270
Can I ask you something?

533
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:10,000
What is it?

534
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,570
It's about my friend.

535
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:40,500
Will you listen to me?

536
00:42:42,270 --> 00:42:43,870
Shut up.

537
00:42:44,340 --> 00:42:46,370
Don't tell me to shut up.
Will you listen to me?

538
00:43:00,690 --> 00:43:02,460
What is it? Are you stupid?

539
00:43:02,930 --> 00:43:05,330
Don't confide in people
about things like that.

540
00:43:05,330 --> 00:43:07,800
It's important! She was
kissed by him!

541
00:43:07,800 --> 00:43:11,470
Decide for yourself if you
want love or friendship.

542
00:43:11,830 --> 00:43:13,640
How can you say that...

543
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:17,440
Do you know it's about me?

544
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:19,280
It's obvious.

545
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:21,110
Are you stupid?

546
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:31,120
This is the money for
your prep school.

547
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:45,070
Julianne doesn't look
peppy. Hang in there.

548
00:43:46,870 --> 00:43:49,770
Are you going to pay
for it or not?

549
00:43:51,570 --> 00:43:54,210
Can I think about it
for a minute?

550
00:43:57,910 --> 00:43:59,880
Can you skip class?

551
00:44:08,990 --> 00:44:12,290
<i>I want to associate with him
for life, so he's a friend.</i>

552
00:44:15,830 --> 00:44:20,230
Satsuki is a friend I want
to associate with for life.

553
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:24,210
I don't care who you fall
in love with,

554
00:44:24,210 --> 00:44:26,410
but don't  break up my
friendship with Satsuki.

555
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:37,150
Julianne, hang in there.

556
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:00,300
EVICTION NOTICE

557
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:08,080
I didn't have money
to pay for that, too.

558
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:18,730
You can come
to live with me.

559
00:45:28,770 --> 00:45:32,970
<i>Those words were warmer
than the warm weather today.</i>
