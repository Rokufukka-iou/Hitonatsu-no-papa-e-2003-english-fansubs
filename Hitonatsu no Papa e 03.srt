1
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:11,630
<i>Mama, it's goodbye
to this room.</i>

2
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,240
<i>The room filled with
memories of you.</i>

3
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:26,750
<i>I'm going to live
with him from today.</i>

4
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,990
<i>This is my new home.</i>

5
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:39,390
<i>I'll be living with
the man that you loved.</i>

6
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:40,630
What are you doing?

7
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:42,530
Don't put it there.

8
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:45,197
Put it in your own room.

9
00:00:45,197 --> 00:00:46,973
What do you mean?

10
00:00:46,973 --> 00:00:49,470
Didn't I tell you before?

11
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:52,913
Don't come into my life.

12
00:00:52,913 --> 00:00:54,793
It's a photo of my mama.

13
00:00:54,793 --> 00:00:56,180
I know.

14
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:58,410
It's the photo of the
woman you loved.

15
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:00,450
She's someone of my past.

16
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:03,279
How can you say that?

17
00:01:03,279 --> 00:01:05,293
Don't put it here.

18
00:01:05,293 --> 00:01:08,120
I don't want any "family"
feeling in this room.

19
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:11,030
Your room is there.

20
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:14,700
Go.

21
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:18,700
What's with that look?
You'll chase the men away.

22
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:20,970
Shut up! What does it
matter to you?

23
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:22,670
Ugly!

24
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:25,527
Don't call me ugly!

25
00:01:25,527 --> 00:01:29,980
What happened with your
friend's boyfriend?

26
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:33,796
Was that about you?

27
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:38,390
She was kissed by her
friend's boyfriend!

28
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:46,790
<i>This is the pits.</i>

29
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:49,460
<i>It was a mistake to move here.</i>

46
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:50,890
Who's this?

47
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:52,960
Sendô Kenkichi...

48
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,464
A man the Sensei
defended ten years ago.

49
00:03:55,464 --> 00:03:57,090
He has a hairy chest.

50
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:59,630
He's nicknamed as
Wild Horse Senkichi.

51
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:03,030
He beat seven gangsters
to a pulp in a fight.

52
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:06,770
He's coming out
of jail tomorrow.

53
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:10,267
Don't let someone
like him out of jail.

54
00:04:10,267 --> 00:04:12,273
Your job it to watch
over him.

55
00:04:12,273 --> 00:04:15,240
He said he was going to
get even when he got out.

56
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,280
But we don't know who
he's planning to go after.

57
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,720
That's what we want
to find out.

58
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,130
- That's for the police to do.
- It's the Sensei's order!

59
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:24,020
Just do as you're told!

60
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:25,790
Don't help yourself
to coffee!

61
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:58,120
Wild Horse Senkichi, huh...

62
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:04,230
He's old already.

63
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,483
What are you doing,
old man?

64
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:19,810
Give us your money,
if you don't want to die.

65
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:31,690
Amateurs like you shouldn't
be flinging this around, or

66
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:34,160
you might get into trouble.

67
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,860
I'm sorry.

68
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,400
He's cool!

69
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:53,480
"Amateurs like you shouldn't
be flinging this around, or

70
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,680
you might get into trouble."

71
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,610
That's really cool.

72
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,970
Who are you?

73
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:22,110
Who told you to tail me?

74
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,220
You're going to get it!

75
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,810
I'll tell you!

76
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:32,150
Who is he?

77
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:35,180
There's a reason for this.

78
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,960
What're you doing there?
Come here quickly.

79
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:43,960
It's a request from Senkichi-san.
Prepare it right.

80
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:50,570
I can't cook.

81
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,910
So Konari-san asked you
to watch me.

82
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:03,810
He was afraid that you might
go out and get even.

83
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:06,350
Don't be ridiculous.

84
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:09,320
Do you want me to go back
to jail at this age?

85
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:11,350
I've had enough of jail life.

86
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:13,820
That's true.

87
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:17,330
He's such a worrywart.

88
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:23,070
I like the way you gulp
down your liquor.

89
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,770
You're a real man.

90
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:29,410
Bring another bottle
of beer.

91
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:37,097
What're you doing?
Bring us a bottle of beer.

92
00:07:37,097 --> 00:07:39,020
Get it yourself.

93
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:41,180
I'm not your maid!

94
00:07:42,390 --> 00:07:44,610
What a way to speak
to your father!

95
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:46,610
- What?
- What!?

96
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:50,430
Will you give it to her?

97
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:54,000
How pathetic.

98
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:56,314
Truly pathetic!

99
00:07:56,314 --> 00:07:58,429
I'm disappointed in you.

100
00:07:58,429 --> 00:08:00,640
She's not properly
disciplined!

101
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:03,144
And you!

102
00:08:03,144 --> 00:08:06,600
What a way to speak
to your father!

103
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,210
To set the record straight,

104
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:10,646
I only found out three weeks
ago that he's my father!

105
00:08:10,646 --> 00:08:12,820
And I'm not legally
registered as his daughter.

106
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:26,560
A lot has been happening.

107
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,870
I see... is that what happened?

108
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,980
You're a man to take
that big step.

109
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:48,250
It's hard to live under
such circumstances.

110
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:54,190
You must've really been
in love with that woman.

111
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,130
Who is she?

112
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,370
Well, she's my...

113
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:10,170
How can you see another
woman, when you have the

114
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:12,040
daughter of your loved one!

115
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:15,790
Don't say that in front
of Asami.

116
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:17,350
Excuse me.

117
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:29,590
Asami-chan, are you leaving?

118
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,230
Are you in shock?

119
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:35,130
Didn't I tell you so?

120
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:40,070
I was wondering how
you'd react if I called you

121
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:43,270
"Asami-chan," instead
of the formal "Dr. Asami."

122
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:47,840
Sorry about that. Sotokoba-chan
is in a good mood today.

123
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:52,820
I got a part in the musical.

124
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,750
Wow!

125
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,834
I've started my
lessons from today.

126
00:09:56,834 --> 00:09:58,420
Great!

127
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,620
We have another
interesting piece of news.

128
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:02,120
What is it?

129
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:04,690
We saw a photo
of Shinpei's old lover.

130
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:07,130
Marimo-chan's mother.

131
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:09,500
There was a photo in
Shinpei's room.

132
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,440
Not that I care.

133
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,640
Bye.

134
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:18,876
That was a bad response.

135
00:10:18,876 --> 00:10:21,510
She might be in greater
shock than she let out.

136
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,650
Living alone...

137
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,120
I made a mistake.

138
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:06,920
- Please be my guarantor.
- What?

139
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:13,730
Listen. A father has
to set his foot down!

140
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:15,670
That's all it takes.

141
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,270
I get it.

142
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:25,640
That would work best in
education a child.

143
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:30,010
What if she gets defiant?

144
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:33,920
- Give it to her.
- With this?

145
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:38,190
The minute she defies you,
she becomes the enemy.

146
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:41,960
Should a man show
his back to the enemy?

147
00:11:42,690 --> 00:11:44,560
The answer is no.

148
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:48,160
I've learned a lot from you.

149
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,200
By the way, who are you?

150
00:11:55,370 --> 00:11:58,110
I have some happy news!

151
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:03,680
You rat! Is this where
you were hiding?

152
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:06,180
A guarantor for
an apartment?

153
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,650
Are you going
to move out of here?

154
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,500
I don't think it's going
to work out, after all.

155
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:21,000
We've led separate lives
for the past 17 years.

156
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,700
I see.

157
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,340
You scared me!

158
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:33,810
Does he look like
the guy that you hate?

159
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:36,180
He looks exactly like him!

160
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:39,950
His name is Traitor Masa.

161
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:42,333
He goes on in life
betraying people.

162
00:12:42,333 --> 00:12:45,290
When I saw his face before
me, it made me furious.

163
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:49,390
Sorry about that.

164
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:54,260
People tell me that
I have a peaceful face.

165
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:58,330
- What does he do?
- This.

166
00:12:58,773 --> 00:13:00,960
Should I even be
associating with him?

167
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,970
Don't worry. What are
you saying?

168
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:09,410
Drink up... with your
own money.

169
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:12,657
Where are you taking me?

170
00:13:12,657 --> 00:13:14,720
Don't look so worried.

171
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,420
Relax.

172
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:23,560
Sorry I'm late.

173
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:26,960
The night is young.

174
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:30,670
This is Senkichi-san.

175
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:34,220
- This is Ran.
- Hello.

176
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:36,670
He just came out of jail.

177
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,727
Give him a good workout.

178
00:13:39,727 --> 00:13:42,140
This is something
small from me.

179
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:46,680
Shinpei, I'll just accept
the thought.

180
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:51,150
I'm sorry to have
wasted your time.

181
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:01,030
He's cool!

182
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:04,000
I really like his character.

183
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:23,820
They're all expensive.

184
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:32,630
I need to pay five months'
worth of rent up front.

185
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:45,170
He mistook me for
someone else and

186
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:48,270
he attacked me and
started choking me.

187
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:51,580
That scared the
wits out of me!

188
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:59,760
I see. So Yôko is
working as an OL now.

189
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:04,330
How is Tatsuo doing?
Has he made a career choice?

190
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:07,130
I haven't received this
month's child support yet.

191
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:12,340
Tatsuo is still in
high school.

192
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:14,200
Please keep your promise.

193
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:34,120
I didn't want you
to see that.

194
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,290
I'm sorry.

195
00:15:37,790 --> 00:15:40,160
Aren't you
disappointed in me?

196
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:44,370
That's not...

197
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:49,740
That hesitation...
shows you think that.

198
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,300
Yes.

199
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,410
I'm sorry.

200
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:06,290
When I was let go
from my job, I thought...

201
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:12,560
If a company won't assure
me of lifetime employment...

202
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:17,087
Then for my next job, I want
to do something that I enjoy.

203
00:16:17,087 --> 00:16:18,870
What do you enjoy?

204
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:21,240
Performing on stage.

205
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:24,683
That's been my dream
since I was little.

206
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:27,710
I understand now...

207
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:29,910
What?

208
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:33,450
...why there's an old
man at that club.

209
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,850
I'm sorry.

210
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:39,117
It's all right, even if
it bothers me a little.

211
00:16:39,117 --> 00:16:40,520
I'm sorry.

212
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:47,130
Yes? It's me.

213
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:55,340
I didn't get the part
in the musical?

214
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,440
What do you mean by that?

215
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:01,910
I've already paid
my money!

216
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:04,450
Hello?

217
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:12,580
I don't buy that.

218
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:15,950
I just said, you failed.

219
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:19,420
I paid the money because
you said I passed.

220
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:21,860
I paid 300,000 yen for
my dancing, singing, and

221
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:23,660
acting lessons.

222
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,700
So?

223
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:29,870
So if I didn't pass,
refund me my money!

224
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:33,200
Please refund my money!

225
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,223
That was supposed
to go to my child support!

226
00:17:36,223 --> 00:17:38,920
- It's not possible.
- What?

227
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:42,110
Did you read the contract?

228
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:44,480
Contract?

229
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:46,950
Damn!

230
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:52,720
Welcome back.

231
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:08,300
- Here.
- Thanks.

232
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:10,710
You're all dressed up today.

233
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:13,503
Can you tell?

234
00:18:13,503 --> 00:18:15,560
I sure can. You look cute.

235
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:17,703
I bought it with my bonus!

236
00:18:17,703 --> 00:18:22,090
Bonus? You got one?
When? When was this?

237
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,190
Sensei, I want to talk
to you.

238
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:30,790
Oh, you're in a meeting.

239
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:33,460
Excuse me.

240
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,270
Sorry for the interruption.

241
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,110
Why is Senkichi here?

242
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,923
Come in quietly!

243
00:18:48,923 --> 00:18:51,520
Will you look at this?

244
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,000
What is it?

245
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:58,953
Senkichi-san!

246
00:18:58,953 --> 00:19:00,860
I asked you to stay at home.

247
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:03,290
What are you doing here?

248
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:05,200
He came to pay his respects.

249
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:08,800
I owe it to Konari-san
that I made it out.

250
00:19:12,570 --> 00:19:16,070
What are you panicking about?

251
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,310
Well, the situation is...

252
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:23,550
It does say so. Excuse me.

253
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,920
It's a typical case of fraud.

254
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:30,390
- What do you mean?
- We're having an audition.

255
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:31,820
There's going to be
an audition fee.

256
00:19:31,820 --> 00:19:32,820
You've been qualified.

257
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,460
There's going to be
a fee for the lessons.

258
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:36,460
You lack the abilities
to keep up with the lessons.

259
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:38,540
You are now disqualified.
Thank you for your time.

260
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:40,600
But they told him he passed.

261
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,830
Look right here
in the fine print.

262
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:46,070
It's a pre-qualification.

263
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:47,270
That's not true!

264
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:49,754
They told me that I passed!

265
00:19:49,754 --> 00:19:51,510
That is why it's a fraud.

266
00:19:52,210 --> 00:19:55,580
What's not written here
will not hold in court.

267
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:57,110
That's the reality of it.

268
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:59,727
What's going to happen
to the money he paid?

269
00:19:59,727 --> 00:20:01,997
Think of it as a lesson
fee in life.

270
00:20:01,997 --> 00:20:03,744
How can you say that!

271
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:05,670
This isn't right!

272
00:20:05,670 --> 00:20:07,360
Can't something be done?

273
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,990
We know that it's fraud.

274
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:11,160
On paper, it's not fraud!

275
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
You're useless.

276
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:17,230
If the law won't protect
you, then...

277
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:20,100
We'll just have to give
them an eye for an eye.

278
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:22,810
Let's go.

279
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:26,010
You can't stop me.

280
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:28,480
I'm going to get you
your money back.

281
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:31,703
If you go, you'll be
arrested by the police.

282
00:20:31,703 --> 00:20:33,496
I don't care.

283
00:20:33,496 --> 00:20:36,334
They took advantage
of my good friend's dream!

284
00:20:36,334 --> 00:20:38,190
I'm not going
to forgive them for it!

285
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,590
Why don't you act
like a father?

286
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:46,860
Senkichi, don't give
him bad ideas.

287
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,930
I'm sorry.

288
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:54,370
That production company
is backed by Kuroisu Gang.

289
00:20:57,170 --> 00:20:58,880
This is the worst
case scenario.

290
00:20:59,310 --> 00:21:01,240
You won't get anything
back from them.

291
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,820
100,000 yen... is high!

292
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:19,030
<i>I've fallen for you.</i>

293
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:28,670
Marimo, I want
to talk to you.

294
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,580
I have nothing to say.

295
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:35,980
Wait.

296
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:41,050
- Wait!
- Let me go!

297
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,270
Why are you running away?

298
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:45,890
What are you doing?

299
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:51,530
What are you trying to do
to her when she's unwilling?

300
00:21:56,030 --> 00:22:00,340
He's a pervert.

301
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:02,570
What?

302
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:12,050
So he did that to you when
he's dating your friend?

303
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,160
You did the right thing.

304
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:23,360
I did, didn't I?

305
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,660
You're not off track.

306
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:31,800
You're not a cat or a dog.

307
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,810
As a person, you must
exercise judgment.

308
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:40,680
But...

309
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:43,750
What are you
brooding about?

310
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:50,020
I'm wondering if my
mama was happy.

311
00:22:52,390 --> 00:22:58,160
I wonder what kind
of love she had...

312
00:22:58,160 --> 00:23:02,230
and why she decided
to have me alone...

313
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:08,770
I wonder how he feels
about my mama now.

314
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:12,810
There are too many
things I don't understand.

315
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,420
Cheer up.

316
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:27,360
Can I go to your room?

317
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:31,660
I don't feel like
dancing today.

318
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:48,710
Can I talk to you?

319
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:53,080
Marimo-chan is thinking
of living alone.

320
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:57,797
She asked me to be
her guarantor.

321
00:23:57,797 --> 00:23:59,190
You?

322
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:53,480
- Is she here?
- Marimo?

323
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,910
She hasn't come yet.

324
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:28,410
Hey!

325
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:32,350
I see... A room...

326
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,650
Is that so?

327
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:41,790
I guess it won't be so
rosy from the start.

328
00:25:43,190 --> 00:25:46,560
I see... So you've
been thinking about it...

329
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:52,300
It'll cost you a lot
of money to move.

330
00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:54,300
Do you have money?

331
00:25:54,910 --> 00:25:58,210
I have my mother's savings
and her life insurance proceeds.

332
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:03,210
Is that so? So you
have money.

333
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:19,393
Welcome back.

334
00:26:19,393 --> 00:26:21,670
Is that Marimo-chan's mother?

335
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:27,140
Were you in love with her?

336
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,710
Never mind about that.

337
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:36,610
Let's go out to eat.

338
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:39,250
I was with Marimo-chan until now.

339
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,090
I heard a lot from her.

340
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:46,220
She's troubled.

341
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:54,900
If you took her in out
of sympathy...

342
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:57,200
then what you did
is a crime.

343
00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:04,170
Hold her tightly in
your arms.

344
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:08,410
- Then it'll all be settled.
- Shut up.

345
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:12,620
It's none of your business.

346
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:18,460
I don't understand it.

347
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:23,630
I find out that I have
a daughter,

348
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:25,660
but her mother is dead.

349
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:27,560
What am I supposed to do?

350
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,500
I don't know what she
told you, but

351
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,940
don't tell me what to do.

352
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:44,980
There's no unity here!

353
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:51,420
We're not open yet!

354
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:55,090
How nice to have time
on your hands!

355
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:59,560
Can I get a drink?

356
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,230
What's wrong, Shinpei?

357
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,450
Are you running away?

358
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:23,820
Like you ran away
from the woman?

359
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,990
What an easy life you have!

360
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:32,430
Keep running away from the
rest of your life! You fool!

361
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,940
Don't give me that.

362
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:43,870
Who's running away?

363
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:47,880
Don't act as if you
know it all!

364
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:00,620
You're the one who's
leading an easy life!

365
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:03,090
You're the one who's
running away in life!

366
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,557
You want to get even?

367
00:29:05,557 --> 00:29:07,230
Then go!

368
00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:09,600
If you think you're so
damn great, then

369
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,570
be my role model!

370
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,140
Don't switch the
story to me!

371
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:23,180
What's with you?

372
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:25,837
What's it to you?

373
00:29:25,837 --> 00:29:27,920
Just leave me alone!

374
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,900
Your kid is crying!

375
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,790
She's suffering!

376
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,143
As a parent, help her!

377
00:29:34,143 --> 00:29:37,330
Help her? What more
do you expect from me?

378
00:29:38,230 --> 00:29:41,900
Shinpei, you really
don't know?

379
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:48,300
She was in front of
the realtor's office.

380
00:29:54,810 --> 00:29:56,980
What are you unhappy
about with me?

381
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,890
When you said you wanted
to go to prep school,

382
00:30:01,890 --> 00:30:04,190
I gave you the money
for it, didn't I?

383
00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:06,090
When you had no place
to live, I offered you

384
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:07,660
my place, didn't I?

385
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:09,426
So what are you unhappy
about with me?

386
00:30:09,426 --> 00:30:11,490
She doesn't need sympathy.

387
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:14,560
Just assume responsibility.

388
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:19,600
Assume the responsibility
of her life.

389
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:24,310
Give me a break, will you?

390
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:27,080
What wrong have I done?

391
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,323
Why am only I being blamed?

392
00:30:31,323 --> 00:30:33,020
What's with you, anyway?

393
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:37,593
Why aren't you coming to me?
Why are you going to them?

394
00:30:37,593 --> 00:30:39,320
You should tell me!

395
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:41,890
What am I to you? Damn it!

396
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:45,860
Why is it them?

397
00:30:47,330 --> 00:30:48,870
You should just come to me!

398
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:50,400
How can she!

399
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,970
What do you mean by that?

400
00:30:55,010 --> 00:30:57,670
What do you mean by that!?

401
00:31:15,090 --> 00:31:17,306
Can I ask you something?

402
00:31:17,306 --> 00:31:18,800
What is it?

403
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:24,570
Do you love my mama?

404
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:33,040
I want to know.

405
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:41,280
Why can't I leave
Mama's photo out?

406
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,300
I...

407
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:01,200
Why was I born?

408
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:12,050
Was I an "accident"?

409
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:17,520
Please tell me.

410
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:45,500
I...

411
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:53,520
...can't look at
Yukino's photo...

412
00:32:56,290 --> 00:33:04,430
...when I think of how she
felt these past 17 years...

413
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:13,840
...and how she felt as she
raised you all these years.

414
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:17,510
It's very painful on me.

415
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:29,460
Yukino was a very
dear person to me.

416
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:40,500
You were...

417
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:53,620
...conceived with
all our love.

418
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:37,460
Mama...

419
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:42,230
Never mind already!

420
00:34:42,870 --> 00:34:44,770
I'm sorry for being cocky!

421
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:48,240
Honesty is best, after all.

422
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:55,880
Yukino didn't come back.

423
00:34:58,750 --> 00:35:02,650
She left Tokyo to care
for her ill mother...

424
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:04,990
...and she never came back.

425
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:08,560
I didn't see her after that.

426
00:35:10,830 --> 00:35:13,530
I had no idea
she was pregnant.

427
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:24,940
Go back to her.

428
00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:31,750
I have some work
to take care of first.

429
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:35,850
An eye for an eye.

430
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,490
I'll go alone.

431
00:35:57,490 --> 00:35:59,710
I owe you one for the
lodging, so I'll go, too.

432
00:36:02,110 --> 00:36:03,840
You're so cool.

433
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,450
He's a man, too.

434
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,460
You both came...

435
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:32,040
That makes me very happy.

436
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:33,570
Let's go.

437
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:08,340
That felt great!

438
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:11,710
Thank you very much.

439
00:37:12,710 --> 00:37:15,430
Senkichi-san, you're
very strong.

440
00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:17,150
I was shocked!

441
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:20,090
You were pretty
strong yourself.

442
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:24,930
I've fallen for you!

443
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:29,530
I have to go to work
now, so excuse me.

444
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:36,400
I'd better get going, too.

445
00:37:36,970 --> 00:37:38,510
Where?

446
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,710
See you.

447
00:37:47,350 --> 00:37:49,250
So you were here, after all.

448
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:57,720
So you're going now, after
you've paid your respects here?

449
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:02,400
I'm sorry. Please let me go.

450
00:38:04,730 --> 00:38:07,430
Why do you dwell on the past?

451
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:14,270
You did as I told you.

452
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:19,810
There's someone who needs you.

453
00:38:24,350 --> 00:38:26,690
Shinpei will be fine.

454
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:29,260
What're you talking about?

455
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:36,700
Konari-san asked me to look
after a stupid parent and child.

456
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:40,300
Is that the real reason?

457
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:47,320
I did it to repay my debt
to Konari-san.

458
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:48,880
Hang in there.

459
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:52,950
Don't gang up on me like that.

460
00:38:57,250 --> 00:39:00,520
Masa who is with the
Kuroisu Gang used to be

461
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:04,260
my younger brother.

462
00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:10,530
And he caused my
gang to disband.

463
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:19,210
I have to set things
straight as his big brother.

464
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:48,370
That fool.

465
00:39:51,370 --> 00:39:54,670
He's always walked
a different path.

466
00:39:58,550 --> 00:40:01,980
Shinpei, be a good father now.

467
00:40:17,730 --> 00:40:21,700
Take his words to heart.

468
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:33,410
That's his final will.

469
00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:52,870
Senkichi-san!

470
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:07,250
Is that true?

471
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:15,720
"Marimo, you were
conceived with all our love."

472
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:21,040
What an exaggerated act.

473
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,060
He really did say that.

474
00:41:31,170 --> 00:41:32,740
Who's that?

475
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,760
Don't mind him.

476
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,480
He's a troubled crybaby.

477
00:41:37,810 --> 00:41:40,110
I'll bring you another drink.

478
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:42,680
Good luck.

479
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:47,950
She's just a memory.
You're here in reality.

480
00:41:59,130 --> 00:42:01,170
She might be
a formidable rival.

481
00:42:03,970 --> 00:42:07,170
I'm on your side,
Asami-chenchei.

482
00:42:07,810 --> 00:42:09,760
You're saying it funny.

483
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,340
Oh, really?

484
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:13,650
<i>Kanpai.</i>

485
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:17,920
Where's Shinpei-san?

486
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:20,920
- I don't know.
- That's cold.

487
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:23,120
I heard about it.

488
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,430
Don't ignore me!

489
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:39,000
Hi.

490
00:42:40,610 --> 00:42:43,540
Where's Senkichi-san?
I thought he was with you.

491
00:42:45,350 --> 00:42:47,280
He left on a trip.

492
00:42:47,850 --> 00:42:49,480
Why?

493
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:52,750
Don't ever forget him.

494
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:02,360
Welcome, everyone!

495
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:10,340
We may have been bonded
by a single piece of paper.

496
00:43:11,110 --> 00:43:14,240
But we don't need that
paper to be married.

497
00:43:14,910 --> 00:43:18,650
Just as long as our hearts
are bonded together!

498
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:24,580
It's show time!

499
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:27,820
Tonight's theme is love!

500
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:31,490
Are you all having
your share of the love?

501
00:43:36,330 --> 00:43:38,870
Let's have a grand
time tonight!

502
00:45:33,610 --> 00:45:35,850
<i>Mama, thank you.</i>

503
00:45:37,890 --> 00:45:39,590
<i>I'm not alone.</i>
