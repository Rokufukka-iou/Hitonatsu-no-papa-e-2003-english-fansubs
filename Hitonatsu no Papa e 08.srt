1
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:15,630
What are you all doing?

2
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:20,040
- The typhoon is coming.
- You'll get blown away!

3
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:26,680
We're working out
to build our stamina.

4
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:31,610
I bought the protein.

5
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:35,520
What? Protein?

6
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:40,060
We all pitched in for it
to get nice muscles.

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,560
Aren't you hiding something?

8
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:52,670
- What's this?
- What is it?

9
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,730
Muscle Museum? Announcing
a new autumn performance?

10
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:00,310
An emergency audition
due to vacancies?

11
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:05,880
Are you all trying for it?

12
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:10,690
Why didn't you tell us
about it? How cold!

13
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:13,590
Ponta is our rival.

14
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:17,880
Why would we want
to notify our rival?

15
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,960
What do you mean by that!?

16
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:22,300
Will you tell me about it!

17
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:27,240
Wait a minute. Aren't
I considered a rival?

18
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,180
What kind of reaction
is that?

19
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:41,320
I'm going to pass it
for sure! Just watch!

20
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:50,390
The high priest was
with Danjiki...

21
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:06,610
How do I write "danjiki"?

22
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,450
You don't know?

23
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:12,570
Seriously?

24
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:15,790
I know how to write it.
I was just testing you.

25
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:20,290
You don't need to test me
on something that easy.

26
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:22,460
Shut up. Just cook
breakfast.

27
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:24,990
That's embarrassing
as a parent.

28
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:27,380
I said I know how to write it!

29
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:32,300
Shinpei! They're terrible!

30
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:35,310
What happened?

31
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,910
Sotokoba-san, I'm sorry.

32
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,970
I won't believe in any
of you anymore.

33
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:45,080
Let's all take it together.

34
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:49,750
- Are you sure?
- Let's give it our best shot!

35
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,190
What's going on?

36
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,110
- Thank you for waiting.
- Did you catch a cold?

37
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:12,340
How unlucky can I be.
I have a date tonight.

38
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:17,810
Date? I haven't gone
on one for a while.

39
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:22,320
I don't care what happens
between you and Marimo.

40
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:26,890
- Please give me your support.
- You and I have a secret.

41
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:30,960
<i>Did you see anybody
you like?</i>

42
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,960
<i>Her!</i>

43
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:34,660
<i>You have good taste.</i>

44
00:03:35,530 --> 00:03:38,250
Don't ever tell
Marimo about it.

45
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:40,560
Women are delicate beings.

46
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,340
If she finds out, you will
definitely be jilted.

47
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:46,410
So you must keep it a secret.

48
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:49,280
Are you listening?
Answer me.

49
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,850
Hey!

50
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:54,250
He looks scary.

51
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:56,390
What are you talking about?

52
00:03:56,390 --> 00:04:00,900
Don't worry. He's quite
open-minded about life.

53
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,590
Men are wolves.

54
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:13,100
It's a mystery to me...

55
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,810
Why is he close to
Rintarô-senpai?

56
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:20,440
Is that the guy that
you like?

57
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:26,120
Is that the guy that
you kissed?

58
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,850
Is that the guy that you
stole from your friend?

59
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:31,720
That doesn't sound nice.

60
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:43,430
So this handsome lad...
is Marimo-chan's boyfriend.

61
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:48,270
I've met you once before.

62
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:53,780
<i>Is the next customer here?
I'll be leaving now.</i>

63
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:59,620
Why did you like
Marimo-chan better?

64
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:03,320
What's so good about
that ugly girl?

65
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,820
Are you going on
a date from now?

66
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,670
Please do as I ask.

67
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:25,140
<i>Was that your daughter?
Is that right?</i>

68
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,080
<i>So your daughter was here.</i>

69
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:31,620
<i>After I got a divorce two
years ago, I haven't seen.</i>

70
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,470
her in a while.

71
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:35,520
What did she come here for?

72
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:40,600
I was shocked myself.

73
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,260
Yôko is getting married.

74
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:47,230
That's good news!

75
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:51,270
You had me worried since
you looked so serious.

76
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:53,340
She's pregnant.

77
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:58,110
So you're going
to be a grandpa.

78
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:00,700
That's great! You'll be
a dancing grandpa!

79
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,880
She asked me to change jobs.

80
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,550
What do you mean?

81
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:10,520
She said although I got
a divorce from her mom,

82
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,790
I am still her dad.

83
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:15,590
So she wants me
to attend her wedding.

84
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:23,200
But she wants me to
have a different job title.

85
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:27,200
She said it won't look
good to have a father that

86
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,540
- is dancing at a pub.
- Is that so?

87
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:33,810
What's with that? Is she
taking the pub cheaply?

88
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:37,010
I agree with the Manager.
The title means nothing.

89
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:40,880
What counts is the heart!
Have confidence in yourself.

90
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,490
- That's right.
- Ignore what she said.

91
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:46,290
I guess.

92
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,230
The situation is delicate
between a parent and child.

93
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,130
<i>I'll be waiting for your call.</i>

94
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:05,640
"Danjiki"...

95
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:11,480
It's summer for you.

96
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,390
Say I want to get married...

97
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:22,530
And I asked you to change jobs.
What will you do?

98
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:24,530
Are you referring to what
you heard earlier?

99
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:27,070
Sotokoba-san looked great.

100
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:32,240
He was troubled about his
daughter. I was envious.

101
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,200
Stupid. She's taking
her father lightly.

102
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:40,270
- Think so?
- He has his own life to live.

103
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:42,750
But she comes along and says
she's pregnant and is getting

104
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,880
married, and she wants to
look good at the wedding,

105
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,250
so she wants him to
change his occupation.

106
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:51,800
I guess it wouldn't
concern you anyway.

107
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,490
Don't bring up marriage.

108
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:55,590
Don't think you're sexy
because you have a boyfriend.

109
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:57,260
I didn't say I was!

110
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:59,700
Go, quickly. Isn't
he waiting for you?

111
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,060
Now I'm mad.

112
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:03,000
You needn't come
home tonight.

113
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,270
- Say!
- Ugly.

114
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:09,170
- You're the worst.
- Ugly!

131
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:28,960
Summer will be over soon.

132
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,160
Say...

133
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,670
When did you come?

134
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:39,940
Summer will be over soon.

135
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,680
Do you want a drink?

136
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:45,410
It's still business hours.

137
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:53,260
I wonder what Satoi is doing.

138
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:55,920
Were you serious about him?

139
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,370
Satoi...

140
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,540
That's scary.

141
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:23,080
I watched the fireworks
with Shinpei last year.

142
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,750
Doctor!

143
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,920
What happened?

144
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:34,260
It's due to a cold
and exhaustion.

145
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:37,730
It's nothing serious.
But you can stay and rest.

146
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:39,620
Thank you.

147
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:42,550
Be sure to lock up
when you leave.

148
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:44,740
I have a spare key on me.

149
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,250
Nurse her well.

150
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:12,530
If Marimo-chan is here, then
Shinpei must be home alone.

151
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:17,210
Does that mean I'm lucky?

152
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:25,010
Is that right?

153
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:32,090
You shouldn't cater
to your child.

154
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,190
Call it love.

155
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:39,390
It's a parent's love to do
all he can for his child.

156
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:42,100
That's not right. You
two have both lost it.

157
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,930
My daughter is very defiant.

158
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:49,940
But I believe that it's
just temporary...

159
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:52,110
I know how you feel.
I went through that.

160
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:55,210
- What old men.
- Never mind about that.

161
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:58,020
We're discussing
Koba-san's job right now

162
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:02,320
How can you change jobs
so easily because of her?

163
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,590
You're not in your
right state of mind.

164
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:06,790
A parent has his own life
to live, just as she has

165
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:08,460
her own life to live.

166
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:11,730
There's a reason why
you are working there.

167
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:15,670
- Yes, until this morning.
- Are you serious?

168
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:19,320
I took off work tonight.

169
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,340
You're going to get
yourself fired.

170
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:23,000
I'm prepared for it.

171
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:27,890
This is a father's resolution.

172
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:31,750
- He's just a stupid father.
- Don't insult him!

173
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:35,180
She's just trying to get
the count in for the wedding.

174
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:37,470
After it's done, she'll
forget about you.

175
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:39,590
There are some things
you shouldn't say!

176
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:43,020
- Take back the "stupid father"!
- Who cares.

177
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:38,410
I'm glad you're feeling better.

178
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:42,480
I'm sorry to spoil
last night.

179
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:45,990
It's all right. See you.

180
00:14:57,330 --> 00:15:01,340
Is that so? So they had
a hot summer experience.

181
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:06,710
It's 30 minutes before
opening! Check everything!

182
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:13,020
Good morning!

183
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:16,050
Sorry about that. Sotokoba-
chan took the day off.

184
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:18,150
It's all right. Just pay
me more on the hourly.

185
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,490
OK.

186
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:23,730
I heard you stayed out.

187
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,800
How do you know that?

188
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:32,940
The "Is that right?" lady was
telling everyone about it.

189
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:35,340
"Is that right?"

190
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:44,950
So you came to see me!
I'm so happy!

191
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:50,650
- Let's have some fun together.
- I'm not here for that.

192
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:53,960
What's the urgency?

193
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:58,030
<i>Your parents are mad?</i>

194
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:05,330
- I stayed out all night.
- With Marimo?

195
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:08,100
Are you dating Marimo?

196
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:12,110
He used to date Marimo's
friend, but now he's

197
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:14,940
dating Marimo. He has
such weak will.

198
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,780
That's very weak-willed.

199
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:18,210
I'm not here to talk
about that.

200
00:16:18,210 --> 00:16:20,020
I'm here to talk about
my parents.

201
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,080
I didn't want to cause
you trouble.

202
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,750
- Don't worry about it.
- My parents are very...

203
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:28,260
All parents talk big.
Don't worry about it.

204
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:30,890
All my customers
are like that.

205
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:33,060
I was just getting a list
of those fathers

206
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:34,630
for my business.

207
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:39,670
Lad, leave it to me.

208
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:48,180
Are you sure? No one
likes to do this job?

209
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,010
I'll do anything.

210
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:59,990
Excuse me... What will
I be doing here?

211
00:16:59,990 --> 00:17:02,420
There's been a lot of
thefts lately.

212
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:06,160
The security camera
isn't enough.

213
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,160
When the thieves come in,
hit the gasoline cans

214
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,230
and chase them away.

215
00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:15,340
We have a security
alarm, too, but...

216
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:23,340
This works best.

217
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:27,250
Do you want the job?

218
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,300
YOTSUBISHI SHÔJI K.K.

219
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:43,800
Yes, I want it.

220
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:53,410
The customers by the
door want to see you.

221
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,300
I'm Mochizuki Marimo.

222
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:19,540
Please have a seat.

223
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:27,880
- Excuse me...
- I'm Rintarô's father.

224
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:32,120
Would you like to have
something to drink?

225
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:36,260
- Iced tea.
- An iced tea for her.

226
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:44,760
I heard you're Rintarô's
junior in high school.

227
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:48,670
Are you a senior?

228
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:55,410
As you know, he's studying
for his entrance exams now.

229
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:58,460
We can't have him
staying out like last night.

230
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:00,380
It's an inconvenience.

231
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:05,890
Don't seduce him.

232
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:08,050
I'm not.

233
00:19:08,050 --> 00:19:10,390
What college are
you trying for?

234
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:13,830
I haven't decided.

235
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:15,980
Are you attending
prep school?

236
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:18,030
- No.
- Why not?

237
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:19,800
Because...

238
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:23,300
What college did your
father graduate from?

239
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:27,970
I don't think he went
to college.

240
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,410
What does your father do?

241
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:36,860
He's a private detective.

242
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:40,390
The one that investigates
on secret love affairs?

243
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:45,890
I feel like I'm being
interrogated.

244
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:47,590
You are.

245
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:51,560
Rintarô's future rests upon
this summer's outcome.

246
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:55,440
We want to get him into
the college of our choice.

247
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,500
And that's important to us.

248
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:02,040
He doesn't need to be
distracted by love now.

249
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:07,050
What does your mother have
to say about the night out?

250
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:13,120
My mother died of
illness two months ago.

251
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:16,680
So you only have a father.

252
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:19,030
A private detective's
daughter?

253
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:22,030
He's working his hardest.

254
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,730
He's working hard for me.

255
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,770
Why do you put it that way?

256
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:35,170
Don't you address your
father as your father?

257
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:43,280
Only after my mama died,
did I find out he's my papa.

258
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:47,320
And that's when I started
to live with him.

259
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,720
But we are...

260
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:53,560
He can't be considered
as a father.

261
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:58,810
Our family environment
is very different from yours.

262
00:20:58,810 --> 00:21:01,970
Our education policies
are different.

263
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:05,100
Please don't see Rintarô again.

264
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:42,340
They're awful.

265
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:50,580
Please don't tell him.

266
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:56,420
He'll be hurt.

267
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:15,710
Hey, you two.

268
00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:19,950
You're in a good mood.

269
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:22,050
I'm supposed to meet
someone for work from now.

270
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:23,720
We'll make ends meet
this month, too.

271
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,650
Good. Treat me
to something good.

272
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:28,420
Sure! Just think about
what you want to eat.

273
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:31,420
- See you later.
- Work hard now!

274
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:33,090
Bye!

275
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:43,800
Did you hear that? He's going
to treat me to something good.

276
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:47,190
I'm going to look forward to it.

277
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:49,070
See you later.

278
00:22:56,820 --> 00:23:00,620
I'm going to work hard
for my 100,000 yen.

279
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:33,420
It's pitch dark.

280
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:44,000
I'm supposed to hit the
cans when the thieves come.

281
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,970
I was shocked.

282
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:49,700
So there are jobs like this.

283
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:52,440
Are you happy with this?

284
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:59,140
Does a parent have
to go that far?

285
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:07,590
A father who has to work in
the dark warehouse for his

286
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:10,120
daughter's wedding day.

287
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:13,530
That's not right, after all.

288
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:20,670
But I want to attend
her wedding.

289
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:28,840
A divorce is like abandoning
your duties as a parent.

290
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:32,240
She has every right
to hate me.

291
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:36,880
But she came to see me.

292
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,820
And that made me happy.

293
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:47,730
I want to respond
to her feelings.

294
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:52,360
I don't understand it.

295
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:58,700
It's OK for her to be
willful at her wedding.

296
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:04,240
That's her day to shine.

297
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:10,420
For that, I would...

298
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:17,120
That's what it means
to be a parent.

299
00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:26,930
My break is over. I'm going.

300
00:25:57,830 --> 00:26:00,170
Konari-san, it's been
a while.

301
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:05,300
Marimo?

302
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:07,300
KONARI LAW OFFICE

303
00:26:07,810 --> 00:26:10,910
She wants to work here?

304
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:16,110
- Did something happen?
- No.

305
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:23,300
I get it.

306
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:27,330
She must like the title of
working for a law firm.

307
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,960
Kids these days can only
think about appearance.

308
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:34,330
Is it something that you
would cry about?

309
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:39,300
<i>I'll do anything.
Please hire me.</i>

310
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:45,970
- What did you say to her?
- I turned her down.

311
00:26:45,970 --> 00:26:48,880
Didn't she ask you to hire
her with tears in her eyes?

312
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:53,110
As her father,
I'm asking you, too.

313
00:26:53,110 --> 00:26:55,190
If she really wants
to work here, then...

314
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:58,070
She wants to quit
school and work here.

315
00:26:58,070 --> 00:26:59,790
Quit school?

316
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:05,480
It's a father's job to earn
money for the family.

317
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:09,670
But it's also your job
to give her peace of mind.

318
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:27,690
Do I need this?

319
00:27:36,930 --> 00:27:38,700
What are you doing?

320
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,910
Getting rid of the
things I don't need.

321
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:44,700
When I moved here, I brought
almost everything with me.

322
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:54,880
What are you doing?
Don't mess things up.

323
00:27:55,650 --> 00:28:00,650
You need these. These
are your current textbooks.

324
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:08,490
What are you planning
to do after you quit school?

325
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:14,930
You're a senior.  You'll
be graduating next year.

326
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:18,100
It's only a half year more.

327
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:24,240
- Did you go to college?
- No.

328
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,180
You really don't know
how to write "danjiki"?

329
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:29,480
You're seriously in trouble.

330
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:32,550
Shut up. I can earn a living
without knowing that.

331
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:34,720
So teach me those things.

332
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,620
School is good, too, but...

333
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:40,290
I thought it'd be better for
me to go out in the real

334
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:42,490
world as soon as possible.

335
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:45,830
I wanted to work at
Konari-san's office

336
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:49,110
and take the bar
exam in my 20's.

337
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:51,600
And become a lawyer.

338
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:54,040
Then...

339
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:59,880
Then I think I will be
acknowledged.

340
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:02,510
By who?

341
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:07,050
Society.

342
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:13,030
So I want to get my
attorney's license.

343
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:26,970
Let's take a five
minutes break!

344
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:33,680
Sotokoba-san!

345
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:46,430
Manager, thank you
for everything.

346
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:54,000
Hey, wait.

347
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:01,110
Manager...

348
00:30:07,110 --> 00:30:09,120
What are you saying?

349
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,450
We promised to make
it up together.

350
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:13,450
Forget about your daughter!

351
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:15,450
You're not in your
right state of mind.

352
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:17,660
Don't give up on
your dream for that.

353
00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:20,090
I envy all of you.

354
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:25,200
You should do what you
want when you're young.

355
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:33,610
Sotokoba-chan, stay.

356
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:39,060
It's neat to have an old
man striving hard here.

357
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:42,280
Some may laugh at it,
but you are the hope of

358
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:44,350
the middle-aged men.

359
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:50,360
I can't. My daughter
is more important.

360
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:56,510
- Damn you!
- Manager?

361
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:58,900
I was trying to be nice here.

362
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:03,400
I'm fine. Don't worry.

363
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:06,300
Stay here!

364
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:11,580
I'm doing it for Yôko!

365
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,690
Want to go drinking?

366
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:32,030
I'd love that!

367
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:34,600
What is it?

368
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:38,440
You're kind.

369
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:42,740
I'm always kind.

370
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:48,780
Shinpei-san!

371
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:52,320
Don't scare me like that.

372
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:54,890
I'm sorry!

373
00:31:57,290 --> 00:32:02,130
My parents said some
awful things to Marimo.

374
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:12,530
- Stay, I said!
- I can't!

375
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:15,140
I want to do whatever
I can for her as a parent!

376
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:18,640
<i>What college did your
father graduate from?</i>

377
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,280
<i>What does your father do?</i>

378
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:24,050
<i>He can't be considered
as a father.</i>

379
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,870
Why?

380
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:35,570
Why didn't you tell me?

381
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,200
I...

382
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:47,920
I was upset, too.

383
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:54,560
I was very upset.

384
00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:08,270
But it's the truth.

385
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:14,740
Then I just have to
change the truth.

386
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,880
If society will accept
me with that,

387
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:19,580
then that's fine.

388
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,950
What are you doing!
Let me go!

389
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:26,520
Let's go home!

390
00:33:30,330 --> 00:33:32,590
I don't think that.

391
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:37,800
- I told you not to seduce him!
- What are you saying!?

392
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:42,090
They were both at my
medical clinic yesterday.

393
00:33:42,090 --> 00:33:44,060
Are you a doctor?

394
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:48,480
Marimo-chan wasn't feeling
well so he was nursing her.

395
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:52,390
It's true. I told you that.

396
00:33:52,390 --> 00:33:54,650
It doesn't matter. Come.

397
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:58,020
I don't like what you said.

398
00:33:58,350 --> 00:34:02,960
You hurt Marimo-chan
a lot with your words.

399
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:10,170
But she asked me to keep
it a secret from her father

400
00:34:10,170 --> 00:34:14,530
- because it'll hurt him.
- Stop it.

401
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:17,540
I think that if you are
a parent...

402
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:19,860
I'm worried as a parent!

403
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:22,640
It's only natural that I worry
about my son's future!

404
00:34:23,810 --> 00:34:27,050
- Who are you?
- Marimo's father.

405
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:30,580
- So you're the one.
- Apologize to Marimo!

406
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:33,050
You're a problem.

407
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:37,660
It's not right for a minor
to work at a place like this.

408
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:39,790
What do you take your
parental responsibilities as?

409
00:34:39,790 --> 00:34:41,800
That has nothing
to do with it!

410
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:44,930
- Let me go!
- Shinpei!

411
00:34:44,930 --> 00:34:46,930
Just make a problem of it!

412
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:49,100
You're the real problem!

413
00:34:50,010 --> 00:34:52,640
Stop interfering into
the kids' affairs!

414
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:54,440
Stop it!

415
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:57,650
It's my problem! Drop it!

416
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:02,520
Just leave me alone.

417
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,160
Let's go home.

418
00:36:13,890 --> 00:36:16,120
A lot of things happen in life.

419
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:21,180
- I'm sorry.
- You can take off today.

420
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:24,570
- I'll work.
- Don't force yourself.

421
00:36:24,570 --> 00:36:27,030
I'll just be alone at home.

422
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:29,640
And I'll feel lonely.

423
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:36,440
I'm sorry to worry you.

424
00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:40,950
Help us out here.

425
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,190
Let's get back to work!

426
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,990
It's going to be busy tonight.

427
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,460
Rintarô!

428
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:19,170
Is your husband home?

429
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,270
Excuse me.

430
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:25,260
What do you think
you are doing?

431
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:26,980
Shinpei!

432
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,750
Stop!

433
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:34,020
What do you want?

434
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:46,330
When you brought up my
parental responsibilities...

435
00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:48,770
- I gave it serious thought.
- How improper can you be!

436
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:50,870
- Leave!
- I don't know what to do.

437
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:53,540
- I'm going to call the police!
- Go right ahead!

438
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:57,110
But please hear me out
until they show up.

439
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:02,950
Shinpei... What are you
trying to do?

440
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:08,390
My mother died in
an auto accident.

441
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:12,090
So I don't know what
child-rearing entails.

442
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:14,620
I don't know the right
things to do.

443
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:17,690
I know that I have
to support her.

444
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:22,343
And I'm trying the
best that I can.

445
00:38:22,343 --> 00:38:26,170
But if that isn't acceptable
by society, then...

446
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:29,370
That just means that
I'm not good enough.

447
00:38:29,370 --> 00:38:32,280
So please don't think badly
of her because of me.

448
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,010
Leave!

449
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:39,620
I'll try my best to be
accepted as her father.

450
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:43,950
I'll even change my job.
I'll find a decent job.

451
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:46,220
I'll do whatever it takes.

452
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:54,630
So please don't rob her
of her tiny happiness.

453
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:01,583
I'm not smart, so this
is all that I can do.

454
00:39:01,583 --> 00:39:03,580
Please!

455
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:10,620
<i>I'm sure she's feeling screwy
to find out that I'm her father.</i>

456
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:14,880
<i>But she's trying her best
to be a family with me.</i>

457
00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:18,320
<i>She's even thinking of
quitting school to go to work.</i>

458
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:22,160
I can't bear to watch that.

459
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:30,170
Please let her keep
her happiness.

460
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,240
- Leave.
- Please!

461
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,000
- Leave!
- Please!

462
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,110
- I'm telling you to leave!
- Please...!

463
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:44,750
Please!

464
00:41:34,830 --> 00:41:37,330
Thanks... for earlier.

465
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:42,430
And... I'm sorry.

466
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:48,640
- What do you mean?
- I went too far.

467
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:55,710
It's rough being a parent.

468
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:00,620
I should say.

469
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:08,290
Don't drop out of school.

470
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:11,800
I'll do all that I can for you.

471
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:14,260
Pursue your dreams in life.

472
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,130
You can go to college, too.

473
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:22,910
I'll work hard so send
you through college.

474
00:42:24,270 --> 00:42:26,440
Please don't change.

475
00:42:28,350 --> 00:42:32,250
I don't think badly
of your lifestyle.

476
00:42:40,790 --> 00:42:45,030
