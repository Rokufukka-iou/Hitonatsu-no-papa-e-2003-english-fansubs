1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:03,160
<i>Non-san is in danger.</i>

2
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,240
<i>What are you doing?</i>

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:12,210
<i>We were going to practice
one last time so that we</i>

4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:14,840
<i>won't have regrets when
one of us is fired.</i>

5
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:29,190
Just look at me...

6
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:34,730
I'm in the newspapers.

7
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:41,800
I look cute!

8
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:50,050
<i>That incident was reported
in the newspapers.</i>

9
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,810
<i>So we were getting
carried away by it.</i>

10
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:06,360
The customers have been
looking at us all week!

11
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:21,610
She's cute.

12
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,680
- Enjoy!
- You're getting carried away.

13
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,490
Can you tell?

14
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:35,420
- Isn't it strange?
- It sure is.

15
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:40,600
Why doesn't the doctor
get any credit for it?

16
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:43,570
- Didn't I help, too?
- So did I.

17
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:47,170
They didn't do anything, but
they get all the attention.

18
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,340
This is truly upsetting.

19
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:51,540
Let's go.

20
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:58,950
Thank you for coming
to our pub today.

21
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:04,550
All kinds of things
happen during the summer.

22
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:06,190
When you want a case solved,

23
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:09,820
come to Kirishima Detective
Office on the third floor.

24
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,400
For your summer colds,
come and see the very

25
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,170
beautiful Dr. Asami.

26
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:26,070
Don't forget what I just said.

27
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:30,310
Let's get into it.

28
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:35,280
Start the music!

29
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:44,230
<i>We had let it get to our head.</i>

30
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:48,010
<i>In hindsight...</i>

31
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:50,400
<i>It was like our final banquet.</i>

48
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,430
It dries fast in the summer!

49
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:56,880
What are you doing?

50
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,710
I thought I'd work here
part-time.

51
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:01,140
Maybe I'll take up dancing.

52
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:05,810
It feels good to be on stage.

53
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:07,680
You were putting
everyone in a spot.

54
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,280
What are you saying?

55
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,850
For someone who hasn't
done anything,

56
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:12,590
you have too much attention.

57
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:14,490
I'm the one who solved
the case.

58
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:18,480
No! I did! I remembered the
culprit's license plate number!

59
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,750
I'm the one who stormed in!

60
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:24,030
Shut up! You're distracting me.

61
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,030
I can't concentrate.

62
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:28,970
Do you understand?

63
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:32,540
My exams are coming up.
I'm under pressure now.

64
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:35,780
It'll determine if I can
become an attorney or not.

65
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:38,310
Will you be a bit more
considerate here?

66
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,950
Why should we get scolded?

67
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,050
Just study at your own home!

68
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:46,890
- The air conditioner is broken.
- Then go to your office!

69
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:49,840
Sensei told me not to come
until the exams are over.

70
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,036
Do you know why he said that?

71
00:05:52,036 --> 00:05:54,590
Because he has high
expectations of me.

72
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:03,470
Sensei, you seem restless.

73
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:08,340
Shall I call Satoi-san in?

74
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:11,710
Don't act on your own.

75
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,750
I wonder if he's studying.

76
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:26,860
Don't you have another
one like this?

77
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,760
Why don't you give it to him?

78
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:34,670
Satoi-san will be elated.

79
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:38,670
He should only be elated
when he passes.

80
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:41,840
You're so stubborn.

81
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:49,280
- You don't have to go.
- I feel uneasy here.

82
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:52,620
With him around, it doesn't
feel like it's my home.

83
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:55,990
He'll hear you, fool!
Sorry.

84
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:59,060
- See you later!
- Take off my T-shirt!

85
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:05,400
Excuse me...

86
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:11,370
- Please hang in there.
- I am.

87
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:14,940
Don't say that to someone
who is already doing that.

88
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:17,310
I meant no harm by it.

89
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:26,520
What's with him?
He upsets me.

90
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:31,260
Hey!

91
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:33,106
Why bring that up now?

92
00:07:33,106 --> 00:07:35,780
What're you saying!
Who do you think I am?

93
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:39,070
I don't understand it, too.

94
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:42,840
Just because you were
in the newspapers...

95
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,640
- Don't let it get to your head!
- We weren't doing that.

96
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:49,240
Why aren't you practicing?

97
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:55,870
It's your time to practice
from noon to opening time.

98
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:58,720
- But that's...
- What is it?

99
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:02,960
The pub has been
very busy lately.

100
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:05,160
And we're exhausted.

101
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,800
Jun, you should quit.

102
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:15,540
- That's awful.
- Stay out of this.

103
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:17,840
Don't decide that on your own!

104
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,070
Who do you think I am?

105
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,700
Are you looking for Shinpei?

106
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,170
You're very attractive.

107
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:58,480
- I think he's at the pub.
- Thanks. I'll go there.

108
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,020
Maybe I'll go, too.

109
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:07,120
I think I'll take a break.

110
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,600
I've been studying hard
all morning.

111
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:14,130
I think I'll feel refreshed
after I have tea with you.

112
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:20,430
It's not a bad feeling to get
popular from an incident as that.

113
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:23,740
As a matter of fact,
it feels great.

114
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:27,340
But that's where it all ends.

115
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:33,180
What happened to that spirit?

116
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,950
Should you be taking it easy?

117
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:42,660
Did you give up your
dream of going up?

118
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:48,960
- What are you doing here?
- To refresh myself.

119
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:53,460
- With Asami?
- I'm ready to go.

120
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:57,170
Am I wrong in what I say?

121
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:03,080
- What do you think?
- You're asking me?

122
00:10:04,810 --> 00:10:07,410
I know what you're saying.

123
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:12,150
You can't grasp your dream
by taking the easy way out.

124
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:13,750
I don't want to hear it
from you.

125
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,360
What is that supposed
to mean?

126
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,430
You've failed the exam
many times. Don't act big.

127
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:21,390
- That isn't the issue here.
- Oh yes, it is.

128
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:23,430
Now, now.

129
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:26,020
Don't be so insulting
in your tone.

130
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:28,600
Everyone just got
a bit carried away.

131
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,140
It won't happen again, right?

132
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:31,810
You were on the
band wagon, too.

133
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:34,910
You've started running,
so you can't stop.

134
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:40,353
- Isn't that right, Asami?
- Don't ask me.

135
00:10:40,353 --> 00:10:43,920
Anybody would get tired,
running everyday.

136
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,350
See? You shouldn't
have said that.

137
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,060
I'm siding with the Manager.

138
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:53,870
You've all changed.

139
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:57,560
- You're all acting strange.
- Don't tell us that.

140
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,800
You're just siding with
the man that you love.

141
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:03,200
- What do you mean?
- The Manager and Non-chan.

142
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,410
- Is that right?
- They were lovers before.

143
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:10,440
The Manager jilted her,
but she still loves him.

144
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:13,030
What a pleasant story!

145
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:14,970
That has nothing to do
with it!

146
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:16,840
You're all being naive!

147
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,760
So you want us to agree
to Jun being fired?

148
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:19,790
Fired?

149
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:21,520
Isn't that what we are
talking about?

150
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,280
Yes, that's what it's about.

151
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:27,850
Manager, that's taking it
to the extremes.

152
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:30,500
Everyone feels bad now.
You shouldn't do that.

153
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,350
They won't change.

154
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:35,577
They learned to make
excuses for themselves.

155
00:11:35,577 --> 00:11:38,970
The pub is busy? So it's
OK to take a break?

156
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:41,510
If it gets that far,
it'll be over for them.

157
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:44,280
They're only human. They
need to take a break sometimes.

158
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:47,030
The Manager isn't wrong.

159
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:48,750
That's what it means
to be a challenger!

160
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,580
Don't get so hot about it.

161
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:54,663
Oh, give me a break!
I'll quit from my side!

162
00:11:54,663 --> 00:11:58,890
- I'm leaving.
- Don't do that.

163
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:07,970
I'm sorry. I'll work
hard at it. So, please...

164
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:10,647
No.

165
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:16,683
Why? He's apologizing.
He's reflecting.

166
00:12:16,683 --> 00:12:18,180
Why are you so cold to him?

167
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,680
A child should stay out
of this!

168
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,950
- Is an adult always right?
- Manager, please!

169
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:29,590
Say there's an audition
for a huge production.

170
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:33,030
Everyone passed except Jun.

171
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:37,600
Will you beg the judges
to let Jun pass, too?

172
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:41,400
If you think that's friendship,
then you're making a big mistake!

173
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,700
That's just sympathy!

174
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:50,080
There are others who would
want to dance here!

175
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:54,384
They're radiant and ambitious!

176
00:12:54,384 --> 00:12:56,580
I want to work with
people like that!

177
00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:00,790
- This is a workplace!
- But...

178
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:07,960
I'm sorry.

179
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,680
That's harsh.

180
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:30,350
We were striving hard
together until earlier.

181
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:32,820
This is like the business world.

182
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:37,190
Manager, if that is the case...

183
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:39,990
Don't say it! Don't say
any more than that!

184
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:42,900
I can't hang in there.

185
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:46,270
Didn't you quit your job
to enter this field?

186
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:48,640
Then you have to be cut
and dry about it.

187
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,370
But...

188
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:54,110
- That's not right.
- No, it's not.

189
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:57,140
- It's harsh in the workplace.
- We're all friends.

190
00:13:57,140 --> 00:14:00,110
You mean co-workers. Rivals!

191
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:01,750
It's just a pub.

192
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:04,620
It's not an audition for
a huge stage production.

193
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:09,333
I can understand the
Manager's feelings.

194
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:11,990
Even when I'm the youngest.

195
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:15,130
So does everyone.

196
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:17,500
So why can't you forgive him?

197
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,370
You're all acting strange.

198
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:23,100
- Let's brood about it more.
- Marimo, stay out of this.

199
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:25,870
He's trying to break them up
abruptly. That's not right.

200
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:28,640
- You're being naive!
- I don't care!

201
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,380
I think I'm in the right.

202
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:34,380
Everyone worked hard together.

203
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:38,180
If you break them up,
they'll be all alone.

204
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:41,290
They can strive hard if
they are with each other!

205
00:14:41,290 --> 00:14:43,320
It's lonely being on your own.

206
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:50,960
Marimo, thanks.

207
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:58,470
I'll re-train myself.

208
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:04,010
Thank you for everything
until now.

209
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:08,730
- Wait!
- Don't come after me!

210
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:12,890
Or we all won't be able
to change!

211
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,430
Why?

212
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:27,900
I don't understand it!

213
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:38,680
I can understand it.

214
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:44,280
That's what it means
to take the challenge.

215
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:51,990
I don't understand it at all!

216
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:08,300
You're such a worrywart, Ma.

217
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,500
Don't worry, I'm very
confident this time.

218
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,700
I really am.

219
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,510
OK.

220
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:22,150
The next time I go home,
I'll have an attorney's badge.

221
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:25,380
I'll talk to you again.

222
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:33,390
What are you thinking about?

223
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:37,430
It's great to be able
to cry for your friend.

224
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:41,130
Marimo-chan understands pain.

225
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,940
The pain of separation.

226
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,380
<i>She's a kind child.</i>

227
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:01,720
You haven't been
seducing me lately.

228
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:05,633
You were very aggressive
before.

229
00:17:05,633 --> 00:17:07,430
That's true.

230
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,200
Hey, it's still business hours.

231
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:17,070
I'm sorry, but...

232
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:20,930
Are you in the middle of
an examination?

233
00:17:20,930 --> 00:17:25,440
- Something like that.
- I think I'm fine now.

234
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:27,710
Please take care.

235
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:35,750
<i>Asami-chan's former fiancé.</i>

236
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,670
I got to see what he's like.

237
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,170
Have you thought about
my marriage proposal?

238
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:59,310
Asami, let's start all over.

239
00:18:01,410 --> 00:18:03,550
I'm in love with someone.

240
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:08,520
Remember the time
we drank all night long?

241
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:15,190
There's a rumor that I spent
a night with my ex-finacé.

242
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:19,160
But he doesn't get jealous.

243
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,130
Who?

244
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:24,200
The man who just left.

245
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,410
No way! He looks shady.

246
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:30,470
He's been focusing his
love on his child lately.

247
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:34,570
- Is he married?
- No, he's not.

248
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:36,880
I don't understand what
you're saying.

249
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:41,220
There are a lot of loose
ends, don't you think?

250
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,760
I heard what happened.

251
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,860
- Where did they go?
- They left.

252
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:59,900
They have to lighten up here!

253
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:17,320
I wonder what it means
to have inner courage.

254
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:24,730
Is it going to be over
with them?

255
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:38,240
<i>I don't think there's such
a thing as luck in life.</i>

256
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:46,650
<i>We have to try our utmost
best like fools to win.</i>

257
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:52,890
That's the kind of pub
I wanted it to be.

258
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:58,200
But they're like rotten
apples now.

259
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,130
You mean, oranges.

260
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:09,910
<i>They're just weak beings helping
and consoling each other.</i>

261
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:14,810
<i>They don't realize they're
heading for an easy life.</i>

262
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,900
They've forgotten the inner
courage in them,

263
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:20,100
and are satisfied dancing
in this small place.

264
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:25,120
They're definitely going
nowhere doing that.

265
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:29,664
That's still not a good
reason to make them quit.

266
00:20:29,664 --> 00:20:36,400
Marimo... you're kind.

267
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,540
You are right in what
you say.

268
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:45,780
But society doesn't
quite work that way.

269
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:55,950
When you cried for them...

270
00:20:56,420 --> 00:21:02,090
It made me indescribably happy.

271
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:10,540
I know in my head that
it can't be helped,

272
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:14,000
and that's how it is
in the adult world.

273
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:18,980
I can see Satoi-san's point.

274
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,280
- That's true.
- Do you understand?

275
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:28,590
No one likes farewells.

276
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,200
You're acting like a parent.

277
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:09,100
I've been thinking
from yesterday...

278
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:12,000
and I concluded that we
were wrong for slacking.

279
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:19,040
But it's not right to fire
Jun to set an example.

280
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:27,210
But I don't know
what we should do.

281
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:36,290
Marimo, I read the newspapers.

282
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,720
And I got your address
from them.

283
00:22:41,590 --> 00:22:46,400
So you moved out of that room.
I searched all over for you.

284
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:55,440
Who is he?

285
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,280
I don't know. But there seems
to be something going on.

286
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:02,050
Is this where you live?

287
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,200
Yes.

288
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:10,750
He's like a friend to me.

289
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,900
That's my father.

290
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,840
I'm Ishizawa.

291
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,450
He was Mama's lover.

292
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:48,030
I fell asleep.

293
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:07,180
Excuse me.

294
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:10,920
I'm sorry to drop by
unexpectedly.

295
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,780
Are you married?

296
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:15,800
Yes.

297
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,990
Were you seeing Yukino
when you have a wife?

298
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:23,690
Don't judge me like that.

299
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:28,930
Not after you abandoned her.

300
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:31,170
What was that?

301
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:34,310
Have you any idea,
how she felt in life,

302
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:40,510
or less yet, how she felt
to deliver the child alone?

303
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:45,950
Have you any idea what
she wanted for Marimo?

304
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,450
Or the dreams she had
for Marimo?

305
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:57,460
And why she needed me?

306
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,800
I don't want to be
judged by you.

307
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:51,010
I'm sorry for bringing
him here.

308
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:02,230
Wait at home.

309
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:16,510
<i>I don't want to be
judged by you.</i>

310
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:23,850
Don't take it out
on Marimo-chan now!

311
00:26:30,250 --> 00:26:32,120
Tell me where I can
reach him.

312
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:37,230
You know his number,
don't you? Tell me.

313
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:43,500
- Why do you want to know?
- I don't know!

314
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:47,440
But I want to tell him
something.

315
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:51,880
Don't.

316
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:58,650
- He was Mama's lover.
- He's married!

317
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:02,620
He took Yukino for granted!
He took her lightly!

318
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:06,060
He looked at her cheaply
for having a child.

319
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:08,630
He's a married man that
played with her feelings!

320
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:10,730
I didn't like it either!

321
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:15,730
But Mama was happy with him.
So that's that.

322
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:25,280
Mama used to get lonely, too.

323
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:30,080
That's when she met him.

324
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:35,820
And it just so happened
that he was married.

325
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:39,960
That's all there is to it.

326
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:49,070
Don't criticize Mama's life.

327
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:14,160
I want to believe that
Mama was happy...

328
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,430
Yukino-san's ex-lover?

329
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:40,080
Shinpei is a basket case
because of it.

330
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:46,570
Those two are real father
and daughter, right?

331
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:49,850
Of course they are!

332
00:28:52,890 --> 00:28:58,060
Just concentrate on tomorrow.

333
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:05,370
Everyone is striving hard
for themselves in life.

334
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:08,540
But...

335
00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:25,050
Make your mother back
at home happy.

336
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,200
Yes.

337
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:37,970
Is that right? Is that
what happened?

338
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:44,140
Marimo-chan is so admirable.

339
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:48,160
Shinpei-san is such a fool.
Why did he say that?

340
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,450
That's true.

341
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:55,520
Women are truly weak beings.

342
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:02,230
On the nights that we drink
in pain and sadness...

343
00:30:02,230 --> 00:30:09,430
We feel so lonely that
we can't sleep alone.

344
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:15,540
I can understand how she felt.

345
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:37,990
I searched all over for you.

346
00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:43,770
I'm Ustunomiya.
I'm Asami's former...

347
00:30:43,770 --> 00:30:46,640
Sorry, I have no spirit
left in me today.

348
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:48,800
Please leave.

349
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:56,680
- What are you doing here?
- How do you feel about Asami?

350
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,220
Will you give me a break today?

351
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:03,150
What're you planning to do
with her when you have a child?

352
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:04,820
What are you saying?

353
00:31:05,860 --> 00:31:07,320
I see.

354
00:31:12,630 --> 00:31:14,860
I have a child, don't I?

355
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:17,870
Aren't you going to fight back?

356
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:20,370
Say something back to me!

357
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:28,010
I don't have the time to be
thinking about her now.

358
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:37,190
Sorry. I have my hands
all tied up now.

359
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:42,460
You've got some gall!

360
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:46,700
That's how I feel.

361
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:15,160
Where did that Shinpei go?

362
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:27,300
What do you have to do
for the second exam?

363
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:31,270
Essay.

364
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,340
From when did you want
to become an attorney?

365
00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:39,490
From the time I decided
to go to college.

366
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:43,850
That's awesome. You had
a dream from that young age.

367
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:48,960
It's a long dream since
I haven't passed yet.

368
00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:52,630
I admire you for chasing
after an impossible dream.

369
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:54,200
Impossible?

370
00:32:55,970 --> 00:33:00,570
I'm sorry. I'm bothering
you, aren't I? Excuse me.

371
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,440
You look fine.

372
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,070
Fool.

373
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:51,850
Yukino-chan is dead.

374
00:33:53,290 --> 00:33:56,660
The dead are eternally happy.

375
00:33:57,490 --> 00:34:00,800
Save your words for the living.

376
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:03,530
Words?

377
00:34:04,030 --> 00:34:05,730
That's right.

378
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:11,940
I'm referring to Marimo-chan.

379
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,450
Satoi-san, you're late!

380
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:32,160
- What time is it now?
- 8:45. I'm sorry, I overslept.

381
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:38,870
I have a favor to ask of you.

382
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:43,220
- Please tell me to hang in there.
- But I thought...

383
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:46,020
<i>Don't tell a person who's
trying hard to hang in there.</i>

384
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:50,650
You're hanging in there,
no matter what happens.

385
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:54,050
So I want to get that
power from you.

386
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:58,920
- Are you sure?
- Please do.

387
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:03,360
Satoi, this is your last spurt!

388
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,890
Let's have a pre-celebration
tonight!

389
00:35:11,830 --> 00:35:13,340
Excuse me!

390
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:20,190
What's going on?

391
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:22,080
You said it has to do
with Marimo.

392
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:24,350
What time is it now?

393
00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:27,050
He's here! Shinpei!

394
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,720
Don't you have something
to tell him?

395
00:35:35,730 --> 00:35:38,130
Spill out everything that
you're keeping down inside!

396
00:35:38,530 --> 00:35:41,550
- See you later.
- Please tell me...

397
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:43,570
Tell you what?

398
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:48,640
What is the dream that
Yukino had for Marimo?

399
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:55,310
Why do you want to know?

400
00:35:57,010 --> 00:35:59,380
I want to realize it for her...

401
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:03,020
...as Marimo's father.

402
00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:09,620
I want to realize it for Yukino.

403
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:15,960
Please tell me.

404
00:36:18,870 --> 00:36:23,810
Can you really realize it?

405
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:30,310
Please tell me!

406
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:37,650
Please! I'll try my best!

407
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:40,860
Please!

408
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:52,130
Hang in there!

409
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:58,410
Which direction is the
examination hall?

410
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:06,950
Hang in there!

411
00:37:09,090 --> 00:37:12,150
- I'm late!
- Please hurry!

412
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,770
When he said he had
his hands full,

413
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:51,080
does it mean I was jilted?

414
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:55,520
Is that right? Is that
what he said to you?

415
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,690
It's confusing, isn't it?

416
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:01,760
Would you like to get
a hearing test?

417
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:04,490
It can't be helped for now.

418
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,760
He took in a great
responsibility.

419
00:38:09,430 --> 00:38:13,330
You have to bear it for now.
Haste makes waste.

420
00:38:14,370 --> 00:38:16,140
That's true.

421
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:31,620
Where were you yesterday?

422
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:34,050
That's too long ago
to remember.

423
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:36,590
Call me if you're not
coming home.

424
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:39,860
I know how to kill time.

425
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:44,460
- But I can't hasten time.
- Are you stupid?

426
00:38:45,630 --> 00:38:49,540
- Hello.
- You're acting mature.

427
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:55,840
Do you still have
your hands full?

428
00:38:56,440 --> 00:39:00,500
- What're you talking about?
- Don't say irresponsible things.

429
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:02,280
What is it?

430
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:07,250
- It's still before opening time!
- Don't be so strict.

431
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:10,520
We're having a pre-celebration
party for my Satoi.

432
00:39:10,830 --> 00:39:12,590
Oh, brother.

433
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:24,000
- What are you doing?
- We're boycotting.

434
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:28,210
What are you saying?
It's before opening time.

435
00:39:28,210 --> 00:39:30,210
- We have just one demand.
- No!

436
00:39:30,210 --> 00:39:32,010
We're against the unfair
dismissal and...

437
00:39:32,010 --> 00:39:35,820
Stop it! Stop being naive!

438
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:40,120
You can be easily replaced.
Isn't that right, Manager?

439
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:45,890
I'm going home.

440
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:48,930
You are?

441
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:52,230
I'll find something I want
to do back at home.

442
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:56,700
- Satoi, what happened?
- I told that to Sensei, too.

443
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:58,840
The results of the exams
won't be out for a while.

444
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:01,640
Are you giving up your dream
of becoming an attorney?

445
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:08,210
Today's exam was very hard.

446
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:14,420
But everyone around me
was just going at it.

447
00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:20,290
I realized today...

448
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:25,330
that they must've tried a
hundred times harder than me.

449
00:40:27,770 --> 00:40:29,440
A hundred times!

450
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:32,210
My dream is too big.

451
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:37,340
- I've come to terms with it.
- Don't say that.

452
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:41,410
But they're not like me.

453
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:46,390
They have glittering eyes.

454
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,860
They can do it.

455
00:40:54,090 --> 00:40:57,160
They can hang in there
because of their friends.

456
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:04,070
So please give them
another chance.

457
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:16,250
What is your favorite song?

458
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:20,390
It's for your farewell party.

459
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,760
I want something beaty.

460
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:36,670
This is your last chance!

461
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:40,540
I'm glad!

462
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:43,880
Thank you!

463
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:51,580
You're old already so you
really have to try hard.

464
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:57,890
My Satoi!

465
00:41:57,890 --> 00:42:02,280
Stop it. Everyone's looking.

466
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:04,900
So what if they're looking.

467
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:08,440
There's nothing going on
between us.

468
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:10,640
It's going to be lonely.

469
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:16,010
- We'll see him again, won't we?
- Yes, we will.

470
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:19,350
We'll still be living in life.

471
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:25,080
People mature with pain.

472
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:27,990
Let's suffer more!

473
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:31,460
Satoi is running away
from his pains,

474
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:33,930
but let us struggle more!

475
00:42:34,730 --> 00:42:38,570
- Oh, shut up!
- Let's hit it!

476
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:55,000

<i>Hang in there!</i>

478
00:44:14,330 --> 00:44:16,260
I will.

479
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:38,750
Your mouth is open!

480
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:44,020
- Oh, it's you.
- Can you see something?

481
00:44:45,630 --> 00:44:48,600
Is there happiness
beyond the clouds?

482
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:52,800
It must be nice to have
time on your hands.

Is Yukino there?

484
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:00,470
I'll give you an ordinary
but peaceful life.

485
00:45:02,010 --> 00:45:04,440
That's the dream Yukino
had for you.

486
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:16,960
It feels good.

487
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:22,230
What's so good about
an ordinary life?

488
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:29,240
That might be impossible
with you.

489
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:34,270
<i>There was a refreshing
breeze blowing through.</i>

490
00:45:35,140 --> 00:45:40,840
<i>I had no idea that we only had
a short time left together.</i>
