00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:02,830
<i>The shape of fate...</i>

2
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:05,300
<i>might be that of
a triangle.</i>

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,440
<i>It must be a triangle.</i>

4
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:15,680
We're not done
with you yet.

5
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:20,050
<i>I'm not sure if it's
because of "him,"</i>

6
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:24,690
<i>but I seem to be heading
definitely towards doom.</i>

7
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:27,020
Will you explain
things to us?

8
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,300
I... don't know myself.

9
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:33,970
- Didn't we break up?
- Is Marimo the reason?

10
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:35,390
That's not it, right?

11
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:37,210
Is it true that you
two kissed?

12
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:39,170
How do I explain that...

13
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,340
I...

14
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:44,280
I have nothing
to do with it.

15
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:46,610
Marimo!

16
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,030
I didn't do anything
wrong, did I?

17
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:58,390
So why am I running away?
Why am I making excuses?

18
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,090
This isn't good.

19
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:15,970
How are things going
as a police detective?

20
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:19,540
I need your help
on something.

21
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:22,730
Sorry. I'm busy with the
festival's security today.

22
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:24,720
I'll be right back.
Wait here.

23
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:28,350
I have something to discuss
with you, too. Wait here.

Don't show up.

26
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,030
Why did you kill him?

27
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:27,780
Shut up. Let's get
out of here.

28
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,560
<i>I've fallen in love
with you.</i>

29
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:47,260
<i>I guess I can't say it
doesn't concern me.</i>

30
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:53,270
- Speed it up here!
- I don't like it.

31
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:55,170
I don't want to be caught.

32
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,850
How long are you going
to drive around here?

33
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:11,070
She saw us.

34
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:13,320
Who cares. Let's get
out of here for now.

35
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,430
How dangerous!

36
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:24,770
<i>Fate is something
decided by God...</i>

37
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:27,610
<i>Or so, someone important
had said in a book.</i>

38
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:30,810
Did I step on stool?

39
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,180
<i>If this is my fate...</i>

40
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,380
<i>then God might be a bully.</i>

TWO WOMEN FIGHT
OVER A MAN

58
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,170
This is terrible.

59
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:45,740
It's hot!

60
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:52,380
Will you be a bit
more considerate?

61
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:54,180
There's a lady here.

62
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:57,290
Don't be so conscious of
me because I'm sexy.

63
00:05:57,290 --> 00:06:00,560
- I am your father.
- You know...!

64
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:03,990
What are you doing?

65
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:08,800
- I am the one paying for it.
- I'm the one who bought it.

66
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,770
Whatever that's in my
refrigerator belongs to me.

67
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:15,870
- You're not friendly at all.
- Don't you have any morals?

68
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:18,370
Even a cat will get attached
to you if you take care of it.

69
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:20,170
Well, excuse me. I'm a person.

70
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:23,210
- You're an irritating person.
- Not even close to you!

71
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:26,850
If you keep that up,
you'll never get a guy.

72
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:30,490
Well, excuse me, but that
isn't the case here.

73
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:34,520
Well, excuse me, excuse me!

74
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:38,430
Then get together with that
guy and live with him.

75
00:06:38,430 --> 00:06:41,200
- You're such a vulgar father.
- Get off my case.

76
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,600
Hey, I'm a bachelor here!

77
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,090
Come here.

78
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:47,200
Clean out your ears
and listen up carefully.

79
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:51,470
After you came, there's been
no woman coming around!

80
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:54,480
That's because you
lack the appeal!

81
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,410
Don't blame it on me!

82
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:59,650
You're making me feel sick!
Put on your pants quickly!

83
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:01,180
Good morning!

84
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,920
Would you like to have
some shaved ice?

85
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:08,190
I heard it's a love triangle.

86
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,730
Did it hit you?

87
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:17,270
So what are you
going to do?

88
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:20,770
Well...

89
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:24,470
I know I have to set
things straight.

90
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:26,340
Are you in a love triangle?

91
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:29,160
You're not talking about me?

92
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,050
I thought you were talking
about Satsuki, Rintarô and me.

93
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:37,210
Isn't he your friend's
boyfriend that you kissed?

94
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:38,910
He's her ex-boyfriend.

95
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:43,160
- And he forced a kiss on me.
- Is that right?

96
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:48,480
- So it's a reckless relationship.
- Well, that's...

97
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:52,400
So you're doing
an immoral thing here.

98
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:55,770
I'm going to my part-time job.

99
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,370
Wretch!

100
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,210
So how are things with you?

101
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:10,790
I heard Asami-chan went
out with her former lover.

102
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,430
Word sure gets around fast.

103
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:16,030
Is that right? Am I fast
with the news?

104
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:21,500
<i>This is the pits. I split
the beans from my side.</i>

105
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:25,900
<i>Now that "Is that right?"
lady knows about it.</i>

106
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,800
<i>This isn't looking good.</i>

107
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,330
I'm going to forget about it.

108
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:38,610
I'm going to focus on my
part-time job today.

109
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:50,630
I don't believe it.
So they have days off.

110
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,660
What did you want to tell
me on our day off?

111
00:08:56,230 --> 00:09:00,070
Don't you think they lack
the spirit these days?

112
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:03,070
- What do you mean?
- In their dancing.

113
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:07,200
There's no vigor or
radiance in their dance.

114
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,170
Maybe they're just tired.

115
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:12,150
It wasn't like that when
we first started this place.

116
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:16,950
There was passion and
ambition in everyone.

117
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,860
<i>Everyone was radiant.</i>

118
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:27,000
So I'm thinking of asking
one person to leave.

119
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,770
- Marimo-chan!
- Are we off today?

120
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:37,570
We're going to practice
our dancing from now.

121
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:39,470
- Want to come along?
- Yes.

122
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,890
On the days the pub is
closed, we practice here.

123
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:55,830
I'm behind in my dancing
progress, so they're

124
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:57,630
keeping me company here.

125
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:00,160
It's doing us good, too.

126
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:02,970
It's all for our dream.

127
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:18,880
How many times will this
be for the bar exam?

128
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:21,380
Twenty-six.

129
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:26,890
Society only looks
at the end result.

130
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,730
If you are serious about
becoming an attorney,

131
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:35,930
then show me the results
in the exams next week.

132
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,300
This is your last chance.

133
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,500
Last?

134
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:51,780
I hope we can pass together.

135
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,080
You look awfully confident.

136
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,530
Those guys!

137
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:18,510
What are you doing, Satoi?

138
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,560
It's noisy!

139
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,620
This isn't your practice
dancing hall!

140
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,620
Sensei may allow it,
but I won't!

141
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:26,480
Go elsewhere to dance!

142
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,280
Who thinks Satoi's voice
is more irritating?

143
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,850
It's five against one,
and we win.

144
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:36,060
Does that vex you?
You want to go to court?

145
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:41,060
- What's the matter?
- It's irritating.

146
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,240
You have it rough, Satoi.

147
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,910
You have to know
when to give up.

148
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:51,710
I'm not giving up.
I'm going to pass it.

149
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:54,380
The words "last chance"
have an awful ring to it.

150
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,750
Don't say that.

151
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,080
Are you confident
you can pass?

152
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,550
Don't ask me that.

153
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:03,450
- Shinpei, I...
- What's wrong?

154
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:08,190
Kusunoki, my friend,
got killed.

155
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:11,260
Killed?

156
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,430
With one gun shut.

157
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,070
<i>They found illegal drugs
in his suit pocket.</i>

158
00:12:37,070 --> 00:12:39,090
The higher-ups think he
was involved in drugs

159
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:41,270
and was killed as a result.

160
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:44,730
But he wouldn't get
involved in that.

161
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:47,130
He was the most earnest
person among my peers.

162
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:48,790
He was always cheerful.

163
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:50,800
But wasn't he carrying
the drugs on him?

164
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,570
If there's evidence...

165
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:55,730
He came to confide
in me yesterday.

166
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:57,730
But I didn't hear him out.

167
00:12:57,730 --> 00:12:59,710
Then he got killed here.

168
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:03,380
I want you to investigate
the truth for me.

169
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:07,080
Or he'll be branded as a
police detective who got

170
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:09,150
involved in drugs.

171
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:11,650
He'll lose all his benefits.

172
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:13,660
When I think about his
family, I don't know

173
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:15,690
what to do anymore.

174
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:19,290
I want to believe that
he's innocent.

175
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:27,770
Is there any witness?

176
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:31,740
If there is, that person
would be killed, too.

177
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:37,210
Witness, huh.

178
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,000
Dream, huh.

179
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:43,680
I should find one, too.

180
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,250
- Marimo-chan!
- Hello!

181
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:51,450
I'm on my lunch break now.
Would you like to join me?

182
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:52,780
Sure.

183
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:57,950
<i>I don't know what to do.</i>

184
00:13:57,950 --> 00:13:59,590
Friendship or love...

185
00:13:59,590 --> 00:14:02,260
I can't choose
between the two.

186
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:04,860
You're greedy,
aren't you?

187
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,070
What do you mean?

188
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:09,230
You don't want to be
disliked by your friends,

189
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:11,270
but you want to go
out with the boy.

190
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:16,170
Life isn't all that rosy.

191
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:21,010
What about you then?

192
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:23,740
What?

193
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:27,390
You have "him" but you went
out with your former fiancé.

194
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:32,320
- Did you see that?
- You want to have both, too.

195
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:34,260
You're not any
different from me.

196
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:38,900
- Adults have to be tactful.
- Children have circumstances.

197
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:43,770
Thank you for lunch.

198
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,440
That's true.

199
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:54,010
What should I do?

200
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:59,330
Do you know anything
about yesterday's incident?

201
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:01,120
I was off yesterday.

202
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:04,090
We don't work at that hour.

203
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,630
Do you know if anyone
was working at that time?

204
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:08,360
Not that I know of.

205
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:12,160
Thanks anyway. Let me know
if you remember anything.

206
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:35,020
I'm sorry to call you out.

207
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:38,600
Satsuki, I...

208
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:41,030
It's all right.
I'm over him.

209
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:43,160
I'm sorry.

210
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:47,270
He kissed me unexpectedly.

211
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:51,040
I only dated him for a week.

212
00:15:51,970 --> 00:15:54,070
But it'll still remain
as a good memory to me.

213
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:57,380
It's all right. It's the
summer. I'll find a new love.

214
00:15:58,010 --> 00:15:59,810
A week?

215
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:02,380
You only dated him
for a week?

216
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:05,080
That's not the point,
is it?

217
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:08,720
I want to remain
as your friend.

218
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:10,820
I'm fine with it.

219
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,220
I'm sorry.

220
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:36,110
That hurts! What are
you trying to do?

221
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:39,050
You're always irate,
aren't you?

222
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:41,140
That's dangerous. What
if I got hurt from it?

223
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:43,120
- Aren't you hungry?
- No, I'm not.

224
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:44,290
Come.

225
00:16:46,190 --> 00:16:48,030
Thank you for waiting.

226
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:58,100
One gets irritable
when he's hungry.

227
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:00,740
Don't hold back and eat.

228
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,240
I'm not hungry.

229
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:12,580
Don't you like <i>gyûdon</i>?
It's delicious.

230
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,390
Wait up.

231
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:23,020
<i>Kimchi</i> is a must-eat
food in the summer!

232
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:24,730
It'll give you energy.

233
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:27,870
I said I'm not hungry!

234
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,800
In that case...

235
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,570
Why can't you offer to
treat me to <i>yakiniku</i>?

236
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:35,240
- It's expensive.
- Still, offer it to me.

237
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,210
If you're worried
that I'm irritable,

238
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:38,780
then offer it to me!

239
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:43,610
Oh, so you're got
the energy now.

240
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:49,190
When you take an
exam in school...

241
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:51,570
School?

242
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,690
There's a time limit,
like 30 minutes.

243
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:55,230
It's 45 minutes.

244
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:02,470
In a relationship between
a man and a woman...

245
00:18:02,470 --> 00:18:04,770
It's complicated, so there
is no right or wrong answer.

246
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:09,440
In other words, just tackle
the problem at your own pace.

247
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,380
If you can't resolve it today,
then work on it tomorrow.

248
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:16,110
And if not tomorrow, then
resolve it down the line.

249
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:19,830
In short, don't rush and panic.

250
00:18:19,830 --> 00:18:22,750
What are you going
to do about Asami-san?

251
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:25,690
As an adult, I have ample...

252
00:18:27,430 --> 00:18:29,560
<i>You have a call coming in.</i>

253
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:36,370
Is that you, Ran?
I'll be right over.

254
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:43,740
Just take it slowly.

255
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:52,950
He's trying to act mature.

256
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,200
Drugs?

257
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:05,630
That's right, drugs.

258
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:10,040
They say you can get
it for cheap lately.

259
00:19:10,810 --> 00:19:13,240
At 50% off.

260
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:17,450
I think the boss there
is involved in it.

261
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:19,520
Who's the boss?

262
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:22,890
Don't ask me.

263
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:28,660
- I can find out, though.
- Please find out.

264
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:39,219
I'm the one who called
earlier. Know anything?

265
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:42,010
I bet you want information
on yesterday's incident.

266
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:43,710
That's right. Do you
know anything?

267
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:45,310
No, we don't.

268
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,320
- Got any?
- Got what?

269
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:52,980
Drugs.

270
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,850
Don't tell him or you
will get caught.

271
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:58,720
Which means, you know.
Tell me, will you?

272
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:05,490
Satoi, go home.
You'll fail again.

273
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:09,600
Shut up. I don't want
you to worry about me.

274
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:13,750
You're scared. Go home.
You're in the way.

275
00:20:13,753 --> 00:20:16,440
I'm only being quiet
to let you look good.

276
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,310
I'm better at gathering
information than you.

277
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:20,420
- You can't do it.
- Yes, I can.

278
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:21,910
This is the place.

279
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,620
It's hot today.

280
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:35,020
I don't know anything.

281
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:40,860
Please try to remember
who was selling drugs lately.

282
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,930
I said I don't know!

283
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:46,770
Let's leave.

284
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,070
Even a rumor will do.

285
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,390
Excuse me.

286
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:11,390
What are you doing?

287
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:16,270
- Kitaoka-san!
- What are you doing here?

288
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,440
I'm Kusunoki's peer.

289
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:22,660
I wanted to deliver his
belongings to his family.

290
00:21:22,667 --> 00:21:24,750
He's under suspicion.

291
00:21:24,754 --> 00:21:29,050
- Don't touch the evidence.
- He's not the type to to that.

292
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:31,110
I know! I believe him, too!

293
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:38,620
Just leave it to me.

294
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:45,930
An answer...

295
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:53,000
If not today, then tomorrow.

296
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,350
That's true.

297
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,150
There's no use panicking.

298
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:44,390
Is he a masher?
He looks very scary!

299
00:22:48,090 --> 00:22:50,260
I thought we were off today.

300
00:23:05,070 --> 00:23:07,030
<i>That doesn't tell me
anything!</i>

301
00:23:07,034 --> 00:23:08,840
Don't talk to me like that!

302
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:11,857
Explain it to me so that
I can understand!

303
00:23:11,857 --> 00:23:14,260
What were you secretly
discussing with Non?

304
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:16,320
What do you mean
by "fire"?

305
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,140
Who do you plan to fire?

306
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:21,890
Shut up! I'm going
to decide that from now!

307
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:27,773
Don't show up on our day
off and eavesdrop!

308
00:23:27,773 --> 00:23:30,970
We overheard it when we
came to get our dancing shoes!

309
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,777
Just don't tell
anyone about it!

310
00:23:33,777 --> 00:23:34,940
Is that clear?

311
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:37,870
We're going to call everyone
together for a meeting.

312
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:41,310
Wait a minute!

313
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:56,790
- Did you hear that?
- I'm sorry.

314
00:23:57,490 --> 00:23:59,500
Will you tell me your opinion?

315
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:03,480
Who should I fire
from the show staff?

316
00:24:03,487 --> 00:24:08,540
<i>Kikugorô, Jun, Kôji, Ponta,
Mitchi, Chôko, or Sotokoba-san?</i>

317
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:11,310
Who do you think
I should cut?

318
00:24:11,810 --> 00:24:13,940
Everyone is trying their best.

319
00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:18,060
They were practicing
on their own today.

320
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:20,280
Who do you think
I should cut?

321
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:25,620
- They're all trying their best.
- They're trying their best?

322
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,260
What I want is results.

323
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:33,700
Life isn't that easy that
all it takes is efforts.

324
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,740
What's going on?

325
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:43,710
One person is going
to get fired.

326
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:47,480
It's his usual joke again.

327
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:53,950
I'm not going to lose.

328
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:59,190
- Same here.
- Same here.

329
00:25:04,130 --> 00:25:10,770
<i>They lack the
competitive spirit.</i>

330
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:14,610
They're good guys
as you say.

331
00:25:14,610 --> 00:25:17,760
But that, alone, won't
make them survive.

332
00:25:17,764 --> 00:25:19,887
You've lost me.

333
00:25:19,887 --> 00:25:24,050
They're like a group of
old college friends.

334
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:27,050
They're not pros who are
trying to make a go at it.

335
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:29,750
Since this is just a pub,

336
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:33,190
they don't think they'll
ever lose their job.

337
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:37,070
It's that naivety that will
destroy the talent in them.

338
00:25:37,074 --> 00:25:38,960
But you don't have
to fire them.

339
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,400
I don't want to cut
anyone, too.

340
00:25:41,407 --> 00:25:45,730
But sometimes, it just
has to be done.

341
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:51,370
We have to get rid of
the rotten apple.

342
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,810
I wonder where Satoi-san is.

343
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:01,580
If he doesn't study
hard, he'll fail.

344
00:26:02,350 --> 00:26:07,690
If we know who's selling it,
then we can find the culprit.

345
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:12,900
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

346
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,760
What a laugh!

347
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,530
You said you were better
at gathering information!

348
00:26:17,530 --> 00:26:19,500
But you were scared
the whole time!

349
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:21,590
No, I wasn't!

350
00:26:21,597 --> 00:26:23,940
You wanted to leave.
You were trembling.

351
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:28,190
- How unsightly!
- I realized today...

352
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:31,320
that sewer rats like you
suit dirty scenes like that!

353
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,460
I'm more fit to delegate.

354
00:26:33,467 --> 00:26:35,680
You're more fit to scramble
in the back alleys.

355
00:26:35,689 --> 00:26:37,120
I'm of attorney calibre.

356
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,036
He's making excuses
for himself.

357
00:26:39,036 --> 00:26:42,530
He's wet his pants.

358
00:26:42,533 --> 00:26:45,880
- You're right.
- No, I haven't!

359
00:26:45,889 --> 00:26:47,250
Go home!

360
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:48,930
That small penis
of his wet his pants.

361
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:51,100
No, I haven't! Feel it!

362
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:56,770
Doesn't he worry or get
jealous over it?

363
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:16,190
Go home and study.
You're bothering us.

364
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:19,140
I can't leave after
I hear that.

365
00:27:19,147 --> 00:27:20,960
I am a man, too.

366
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:23,700
So what're you
going to do?

367
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:28,470
Is someone being targeted?

368
00:27:30,170 --> 00:27:32,110
There's a strange car outside.

369
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:41,650
- What's that car?
- They must be killers.

370
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:45,290
You kept snooping around,
so they sent men after you.

371
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:47,694
What fools!

372
00:27:47,694 --> 00:27:49,560
I have nothing
to do with this!

373
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:53,960
So he runs away
at the crucial moment.

374
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:57,200
Why do you think that
car is suspicious?

375
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,500
Because I saw that
car this afternoon, too.

376
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:04,110
Wait a minute... Where
did I see it again?

377
00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:07,810
<i>Life isn't all that rosy.</i>

378
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:14,127
I know, I was with
Marimo-chan.

379
00:28:14,127 --> 00:28:15,910
Is Marimo-chan
being targeted?

380
00:28:15,913 --> 00:28:17,620
Why Marimo?

381
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:25,370
Manager, you should
tell everyone that.

382
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:29,747
Then they will try
even harder.

383
00:28:29,747 --> 00:28:31,710
Don't be an idealist.

384
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,510
What's wrong with that?

385
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:37,850
Adults are always...

386
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:39,870
Are you going
to support them?

387
00:28:39,877 --> 00:28:42,140
Can you assure
their success in life?

388
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:45,090
It's my job to teach them
the harsh realities of life!

389
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:50,960
Manager, you're mean.

390
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,430
Marimo!

391
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:57,700
It's hardest on the Manager.

392
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:00,540
Please understand that.

393
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,100
I...

394
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:08,010
...can't understand it.

395
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:13,670
- The Manager is just trying to...
- I don't understand it!

396
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:16,790
Why do you say that?
You're such a kid!

397
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:19,420
I just don't understand it,
old lady!

398
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:26,260
- She came out.
- Get her.

399
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:41,480
Marimo!

400
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:44,810
What an unfortunate...

401
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:48,990
- Who are you?
- What is it?

402
00:29:48,990 --> 00:29:51,990
- Who are you?
- Non.

403
00:29:57,530 --> 00:30:00,530
Marimo? Why are you there?

404
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:04,100
Non-san and I were arguing.

405
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:06,970
Then we were grappling.

406
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:15,650
Watch out, fool!

407
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:23,050
Are you serious about it?

408
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:25,760
I'm sorry.

409
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:31,360
It looks like your goal is
to take the bar exam and

410
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:34,100
not to pass it.

411
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:37,670
- That's not true.
- You needn't come anymore.

412
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:42,170
Please wait, Sensei.
I'll study diligently.

413
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,420
I'll try my hardest.

414
00:30:45,427 --> 00:30:47,780
I'll definitely pass
the exam next week!

415
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:50,180
So please don't say that.

416
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,050
Thanks.

417
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:02,360
Sensei... I think Satoi-san
is trying his best.

418
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,707
What you said earlier...

419
00:31:05,707 --> 00:31:09,170
About not coming to work
until the exam is over?

420
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:14,870
Unlike you, he lacks focus.

421
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:37,430
It's being smuggled
in from the Continent.

422
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:43,130
They're drugs that were
confiscated in the past.

423
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:44,830
What do you mean?

424
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:55,850
Someone in the police is
doing illegal channeling.

425
00:31:55,850 --> 00:31:58,350
Who?

426
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:04,550
Does that have anything to do
with the guys who are after me?

427
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:09,390
Aren't there too many
people here?

428
00:32:09,890 --> 00:32:13,530
Please tell me more about
the illegal channeling.

429
00:32:23,070 --> 00:32:27,080
So there was a case
like that last night.

430
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,480
The man who was killed
was his friend.

431
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:38,920
I was in this area last night.

432
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:44,430
Come to think of it...

433
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:51,970
Don't tell me the culprits
were in that car.

434
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,140
Did you see the culprits?

435
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,440
Remember what kind
of car it was.

436
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,740
- What color?
- How many were inside?

437
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:10,340
- Did you see their faces?
- Don't ask all at once.

438
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:12,330
You're useless.

439
00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:14,510
I didn't think it was
the culprits' car.

440
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:15,880
How would I remember it?

441
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,680
It was only yesterday.
Try to remember it.

442
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,460
I'm trying to remember.

443
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:20,790
What kind of memory
do you have?

444
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:22,480
Shut up!

445
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,720
Can't you remember
anything?

446
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,390
Will you be quiet for a bit?

447
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:32,260
If it's the car that was
parked out there earlier...

448
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:35,130
Do you remember the
license number of that car?

449
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:38,100
What about you?

450
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:42,270
You should talk!

451
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:44,480
You were looking at it
as the culprits' car!

452
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,140
That only happened less
than an hour ago!

453
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:47,970
What kind of memory
do you have?

454
00:33:47,970 --> 00:33:49,310
Sorry.

455
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:51,120
How can you be a private
detective at that?

456
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:54,890
- Don't tell me that.
- The car... was a sedan.

457
00:33:56,790 --> 00:33:59,160
Is that the car that
passed me earlier?

458
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:01,760
Then the color was navy blue.

459
00:34:02,430 --> 00:34:06,030
The license plate read
"Shinagawa..."

460
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:09,530
The number is...

461
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:16,570
<i>Did you call me
an old lady?</i>

462
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:30,390
<i>Marimo!</i>

463
00:34:47,870 --> 00:34:50,010
I remember!

464
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:55,150
Who is she?

465
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:58,020
I don't know.

466
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:00,450
She just showed up in my car.

467
00:35:00,450 --> 00:35:02,690
Like an illusion.

468
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:04,960
We'll just have to kill her.

469
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:13,600
I found out the owner
of the car.

470
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:18,370
Kitaoka Shûzô, who lives
in Setagaya-ku...

471
00:35:18,370 --> 00:35:20,140
Wait a minute.

472
00:35:22,810 --> 00:35:26,980
Kitaoka Shûzô is my superior.

473
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:30,650
Your superior?

474
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:36,850
Now, now. So he's the culprit?

475
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:39,470
What's going on?

476
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:41,900
The one who should be
cracking down on drugs

477
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:44,200
is being taken in by the
drugs and is selling them

478
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,530
to the fools for want
of money.

479
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:52,040
Kusunoki's lips were
sealed because he found out.

480
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:58,740
How dirty.

481
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:04,150
- That's terrible.
- We should notify the police.

482
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:05,880
Please wait.

483
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,660
I don't want to believe that.

484
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:19,530
He's trying his best to prove
that Kusunoki is innocent.

485
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,800
<i>I believe him, too!</i>

486
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:26,440
He's the superior that
I respect most.

487
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:30,040
He would never do that.

488
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,980
What do we do?

489
00:36:38,050 --> 00:36:41,020
Let's give him time
to think things over.

490
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:44,790
What are you saying?

491
00:36:46,090 --> 00:36:48,330
Don't be convinced.

492
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:51,260
He's troubled right now.

493
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,000
Wasn't your friend killed?

494
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:57,540
I don't know how he was
in the past, but...

495
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:59,670
He's the bad guy now.

496
00:37:00,070 --> 00:37:02,240
He's a villain.

497
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:06,010
Don't sympathize with him.

498
00:37:06,910 --> 00:37:10,550
The Manager is having it
hard, too.

499
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:15,090
He's worried about
all of you.

500
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:19,600
He's troubled and sad of
having to fire someone.

501
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:22,480
- What're you talking about?
- Fire someone?

502
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:27,330
That's what it means
to be an adult.

503
00:37:31,670 --> 00:37:34,170
Adults are sly!

504
00:37:37,210 --> 00:37:40,050
You want to clear your
friend's name,

505
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:43,050
but you want to believe
in your superior.

506
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:46,680
What's bad is bad.

507
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:49,590
There is only one answer.

508
00:37:51,490 --> 00:37:53,560
Non-san is in danger.

509
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:12,880
Is that right?
Is that what he said?

510
00:38:14,610 --> 00:38:16,780
It's hopeless for me.

511
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,920
Not after he went that far.

512
00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:27,260
- Cheer up.
- I have the fighting spirit.

513
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:30,160
But I get too nervous
during the exams.

514
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:33,030
So I can't show the results.

515
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:49,950
Shall we go somewhere dark?

516
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:25,200
- Where?
- Here.

517
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:34,230
There's a group out there.

518
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:45,270
Are they the guards?

519
00:39:46,370 --> 00:39:50,200
- What are we going to do?
- I'll call for aid. Wait.

520
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:53,580
- We can't be waiting.
- They're real yakuza.

521
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:55,470
We'll stand no chance
against them.

522
00:39:55,470 --> 00:39:57,550
We just have to storm in.

523
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:09,330
What is it?

524
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:12,930
- What are you doing?
- Practice.

525
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:15,830
We were going to practice
one last time so that we

526
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:18,130
won't have regrets when
one of us is fired.

527
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,300
I wasn't invited.

528
00:40:22,710 --> 00:40:24,680
What are you doing here?

529
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:39,160
Kitaoka-san!

530
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,700
Do you realize what
you are doing?

531
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:56,540
I only meant to do it once!

532
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:01,780
Why did you kill Kusunoki?

533
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:05,350
When did you turn that way?

534
00:41:06,450 --> 00:41:08,550
Aren't you a police detective?

535
00:41:08,990 --> 00:41:12,720
What happened to your
initial spirit?

536
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:25,770
I don't know what happened
myself! Before I knew it...

537
00:41:25,770 --> 00:41:29,310
I was selling the drugs
that I had confiscated.

538
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:33,210
The money kept pouring
in so I couldn't stop.

539
00:41:33,850 --> 00:41:35,810
There is only one answer.

540
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:39,150
What's bad is bad.

541
00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:45,690
Then Kusunoki found out, so...

542
00:41:58,710 --> 00:42:02,840
You're trash.

543
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,510
Please let me go.

544
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:12,150
Get real!

545
00:42:38,710 --> 00:42:40,610
Are you all right?

546
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:46,120
Why do people change?

547
00:42:48,890 --> 00:42:51,260
The greed in you
grows with age.

548
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:55,890
Be it money, status,
women, or wealth.

549
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,230
They're greedy fools.

550
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,770
Are you the same?

551
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:10,510
I don't understand adults.

552
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:15,410
I got something that
I didn't want.

553
00:43:18,150 --> 00:43:19,650
You're the worst.

554
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:28,660
Greedy fools?

555
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:32,000
Falling in love with your
friend's boyfriend is the

556
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,530
- start of greed, too.
- He's her ex-boyfriend.

557
00:43:37,170 --> 00:43:38,940
Hey, lady!

558
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:42,710
Shinpei-san?

559
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:46,240
You must want more.
Not today, though.

560
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:49,880
- I have a schedule, too.
- Do you know each other?

561
00:43:49,880 --> 00:43:52,050
The other day, we...

562
00:43:55,220 --> 00:43:57,790
Is he the one you love?

563
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:03,890
Why are you blushing?

564
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:06,800
What's your relationship
to each other?

565
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,300
Father and daughter.

566
00:44:09,430 --> 00:44:11,780
Isn't that a surprise?

567
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:14,610
- She's my daughter.
- How do you know each other?

568
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:16,910
The other day, we...

569
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:25,020
<i>Did you see anybody
you like?</i>

570
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:26,820
<i>Her!</i>

571
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:30,500
<i>You have good taste.</i>

572
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:33,300
<i>- Don't tell her.
- Of course.</i>

573
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:39,200
Something seems suspicious.

574
00:44:40,470 --> 00:44:43,000
Go on a date with him.

575
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:45,070
To the karaoke box or club.

576
00:44:45,070 --> 00:44:46,800
Or even a love hotel.

577
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:48,870
Hey!

578
00:44:51,210 --> 00:44:54,550
- Enjoy yourselves with this.
- I don't want it.

579
00:44:55,310 --> 00:44:57,080
See you later.

580
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:02,950
He's cool.

581
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:05,860
How do you know him?

582
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:16,560
- Let's go.
- Where?

583
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:19,940
To the karaoke box.
Or maybe the club.

584
00:45:20,410 --> 00:45:22,610
Or maybe to the hotel.

585
00:45:23,110 --> 00:45:24,610
Hey!

586
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:27,980
<i>He's aggressive.</i>

587
00:45:28,550 --> 00:45:33,620
<i>God, is this my reward for
trying so hard today?</i>

588
00:45:35,620 --> 00:45:38,560
<i>Is this for real?</i>
