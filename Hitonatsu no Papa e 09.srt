1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:04,200
<i>Please don't see Rintarô again.</i>

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:09,500
<i>I'm sure she's feeling screwy
to find out that I'm her father.</i>

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:14,000
<i>Please let her keep
her happiness.</i>

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,200
<i>Leave.</i>

5
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,100
<i>Marimo!</i>

6
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:46,130
So it's just a cold.

7
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:48,900
She gave me a scare!

8
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:53,010
She must've worn herself
out from everything.

9
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:57,640
With Rintarô-kun and
Sotokoba-san.

10
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:01,650
It must've hit her
all at once.

11
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,550
A lot has been going
on for you, too.

12
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:08,690
<i>What do you take your
parental responsibilities as?</i>

13
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:10,320
<i>That has nothing
to do with it!</i>

14
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:16,900
How about beef with
potatoes and rolled eggs?

15
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:19,570
What is it?

16
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,670
You haven't cooked
for me in a long time.

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,110
Well, the situation isn't
the same as before.

18
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:34,310
I feel like a youth now.

19
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,220
Stop it. I'm cooking now.

20
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:42,790
I don't believe this.

21
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:46,560
I want to use the bathroom.

22
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:56,900
It's making me sick!

23
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:02,640
I'm sorry. I want
to use the bathroom.

24
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:11,720
Isn't that awful? I'm lying
in bed with a cold.

25
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:16,290
But those two were
getting it on together.

26
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:17,760
Can you believe that?

27
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,000
So I yelled and stopped
them in the act.

28
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,760
Is that right?

29
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:24,500
So you broke the
two up in the act?

30
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,730
- Isn't that improper?
- What did Dr. Asami do?

31
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,560
She left a while later.

32
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:33,780
Is that right? So you
chased her out.

33
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,780
Don't say it like that.

34
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:38,780
Is that right?

35
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:41,740
The little devil picked on
her future stepmother.

36
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:43,820
Don't say it like that.

37
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:47,220
Never mind already.

38
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:53,360
That's the face of a
daughter who is jealous

39
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,970
that her father is getting
close to the woman he loves.

40
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:58,470
Is that right?

41
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:01,400
You're not saying it right.

42
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:04,140
Try it again.

43
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:08,510
We're in the semi-finals now!

44
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:15,180
We have a full stadium with
an audience of 54,000!

45
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:19,250
And the throws!

46
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,650
He just gave a glare!

47
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:24,560
The coach gives an order!

48
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,230
And he throws!

49
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:31,800
- What do you think of that?
- What do you mean?

50
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,200
Did I get across the
feelings of the Yokohama

51
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,430
team and their coach?

52
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:37,000
There's a <i>mamono</i>
at the Kôshien.

53
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,210
- There's a <i>marimo</i>?
- Not <i>marimo</i> but <i>mamono</i>!

54
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:43,750
Don't you youngsters get it?

55
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:46,680
Love.

56
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:49,850
Do you understand?

57
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:54,120
That's right. Coach Watanabe's
love for his students is in

58
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,520
that single ball. The coach
said something good...

59
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:00,390
Is that right?

60
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:05,230
They're on the same
wavelength...

61
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:14,410
<i>Those two were trying
to be lovey-dovey...</i>

62
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:20,380
Does that mean...
that I interrupted?

63
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,420
Oh, no. That makes it
hard for me to stay here.

64
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:30,060
I got lucky!

65
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:33,260
I got an overnight
onsen trip for two.

66
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:36,330
I won it in the lottery
for the shopping district.

67
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:38,300
A onsen trip? How nice!

68
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,600
- Get ready.
- Serious?

69
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,700
It'll make a nice memory
for this summer.

70
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,070
- Let's have a grand time!
- Are we going from now?

71
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:51,340
On second thought, I'll pass.

72
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,880
You should go with Asami-san.

73
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,080
Yes, go with Asami-san!

74
00:04:56,850 --> 00:04:59,020
You're blushing!

75
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,500
I want to take you.

76
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:07,110
No! Why do I have to go
with you to the onsen?

77
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:09,620
I don't want to share
a room with you!

78
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:12,800
What's the difference
from here?

79
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,000
There's a curtain to
separate our areas!

80
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,680
Stop talking back!
Just get ready!

81
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,170
- No one's home!
- It's me, Rintarô!

82
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,290
You left home?

83
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:27,350
I had a fight with my
dad and I left home.

84
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:32,080
I figured Shinpei-san would
understand how I feel.

85
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:34,830
I'm sorry for barging
my way in.

86
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:37,240
<i>Rintarô-senpai came
to our house.</i>

87
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,810
<i>It appears that he might
end up living with us.</i>

88
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:42,790
<i>My summer is about
to take a sudden turn...</i>

89
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:48,940
No. Go home. Your
parents must be worried.

90
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:54,470
It's an inconvenience. Go.

91
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:08,120
What is he thinking
of anyway?

92
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,390
This isn't a shelter
for runaways.

93
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:12,330
Why aren't you
helping him?

94
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:15,320
- Why should I?
- He's in a bind.

95
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:18,230
I know! You want
to live with him here.

96
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:22,270
- You have such a dirty mind!
- Never mind already.

97
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:30,180
What's with her?

98
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:34,610
<i>What's with him?
He sure upsets me.</i>

99
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:48,070
You're doing
the same thing!

100
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:51,010
- I'm sorry.
- Stop smiling!

101
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:55,400
- Do your job properly!
- Sotokoba-san!

The customers really
liked it!

120
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:02,680
You were great!

121
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:06,380
Sotokoba-san didn't come.

122
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:08,920
Is he quitting, after all?

123
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:13,350
I doubt it. He came up on
stage and danced yesterday.

124
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:15,690
But he didn't show up today.

125
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:17,860
If he was going to stay,
he would've showed up.

126
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:21,400
Maybe he thought about
his daughter's wedding.

127
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,330
Changing jobs for
his daughter...

128
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:25,840
That's something I just
don't understand.

129
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,000
If he wants to quit,
that's fine.

130
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,140
But if that's the case,
we'll have to change

131
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:32,320
everyone's positions.
Please think about that.

132
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,540
- I'm going.
- Wait!

133
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:39,180
What's with him?
Isn't he awfully cold?

134
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,790
It's scary in here.

135
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:09,910
Sotokoba-san!

136
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,680
Thanks.

137
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:20,950
You scared me.

138
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:23,890
My heart is still beating fast.

139
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,290
Aren't you going
back to the pub?

140

YOTSUBISHI SHÔJI K.K.

141
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:34,170
Everyone is waiting for you.

142
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:41,810
I thought it was nice...

143
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:47,310
To see you troubled over
your daughter getting married.

144
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:55,520
But I don't like what I see now.

145
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:01,930
It's not like you...
so I don't like it.

146
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,380
So she turned you down.

147
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,350
Your plan didn't work.

148
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:24,780
These tickets cost me a lot.

149
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:27,650
Shall you and I go?

150
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:31,390
I guess that wouldn't work.

151
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:37,100
She doesn't understand
my feelings.

152
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,940
That's a father for you.

153
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:58,750
A father, huh...

154
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,490
Can I say something?

155
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:07,990
I know. You want to keep
this a secret from everyone.

156
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:11,230
This is hard for me to say...

157
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:14,230
I want you to erase from
your memory what happened

158
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:16,430
from yesterday till today.

159
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:19,870
- Are you listening?
- Sotokoba-san is here.

160
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:28,420
I'm sorry to call you out
before your wedding.

161
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:30,320
What did you want to tell me?

162
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:35,350
Here. This is where
I work now.

163
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:40,730
- This is a first-rate company.
- My friend got me in.

164
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:43,850
Wow! So you did as I asked.

165
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:46,110
Of course.

166
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:48,800
So you'll be working here
when I get married.

167
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,200
- That's right.
- Thank you!

168
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,400
BREAKFAST IS IN THE REFRIG-
ERATOR. DON'T DRINK TOO MUCH!

169
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,700
I'M OFF TO MY PART-TIME JOB.

170
00:13:32,510 --> 00:13:34,900
- <i>Did you go to college?
- No.</i>

171
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:36,280
<i>You're seriously in trouble.</i>

172
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:39,250
<i>Shut up. I can earn a living
without knowing that.</i>

173
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:53,400
<i>What do you take your
parental responsibilities as?</i>

174
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:15,090
What's wrong? You look dead.

175
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,990
Regarding this...

176
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:25,970
...that says that
Marimo is my daughter...

177
00:14:27,330 --> 00:14:31,940
Legally... having me
as a father is...

178
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:39,550
Did you wash your face?

179
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:47,550
What are you doing!?

180
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:50,190
Is it that harsh?

181
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:54,490
I don't understand it...

182
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:57,970
...even after thinking long
and hard about it!

183
00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:02,030
Is Marimo really happy,
having me as a father?

184
00:15:05,210 --> 00:15:09,740
I really don't know
what to do anymore.

185
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,710
You'll be fine.

186
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,820
You're trying your best,
without running away.

187
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:23,920
You're not the one who
has to make the decision.

188
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,570
That's awful. How can he
throw you into the sea?

189
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,240
Shall I run him in for you?

190
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:48,750
Marimo's boyfriend ran away
from home and came to me.

191
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:51,530
But I turned him away.

192
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:54,520
That's only normal. No one
would acknowledge that.

193
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:59,860
I was afraid his father
would say something again.

194
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:05,560
I thought I'd be accused of
being improper and irresponsible.

195
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:08,970
I don't mind him talking
badly about me, but...

196
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:14,240
I don't want him to judge
Marimo in the same light.

197
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:22,480
I can understand
Koba-san's feelings.

198
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:33,530
What are parents for?

199
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,800
We're living for our children.

200
00:16:46,070 --> 00:16:48,810
That's stale!

201
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:54,810
- Stop trying to look good.
- What's wrong with that?

202
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:58,280
Shinpei-san isn't coming back.

203
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:02,520
Never mind about him.

204
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:08,930
He has every right
to be angry with me.

205
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:17,000
I was running to him for help.

206
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:20,970
Don't say that.

207
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:24,740
He's wrong to have
told you off like that.

208
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:37,480
I have to go now. I have
to attend my night classes.

209
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,890
I can't flunk my college
entrance exams twice.

210
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:45,260
I'll be back to formally
apologize to Shinpei-san.

211
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:56,380
College entrance
exams, huh...

212
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,820
What's going on?

213
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:09,250
Yes, I understand.

214
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:12,560
I'll be expecting you.

215
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:19,970
I, Manager Okamoto, have
accepted the message.

216
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:27,870
- How was it?
- That was Nakamori Ryûji!

217
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:34,880
The producer for the
Muscle Museum musical!

218
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:38,120
He's coming here tomorrow!

219
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:43,460
He's coming to check us out!

220
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:47,830
Does that mean someone
is going to be chosen?

221
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,130
This is your opportunity!

222
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:55,630
If someone from
our pub is chosen...

223
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:05,080
What's all the ruckus?

224
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:08,680
Nakamori Ryûji
is coming to this pub.

225
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:10,880
He's the producer for
the Muscle Museum!

226
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,920
I'm a fan of his!

227
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:17,490
Let's practice hard!

228
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,990
Let's shock him!

229
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:24,630
Everyone, get to
your positions!

230
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:30,870
Let's start!

231
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,980
What about Sotokoba-san?

232
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:48,020
If he's not coming, we have
to change the formation.

233
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,560
If he is coming, then
we can leave it as it is.

234
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:53,630
Manager.

235
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:57,200
Let's leave it open for him.

236
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:03,130
Wait a minute. Isn't that
being too soft-hearted?

237
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:06,770
- What do you mean?
- You said before...

238
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:10,440
That if we all took the
audition and someone failed...

239
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:14,910
Are we going to beg the
producer to include our friend?

240
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:18,450
Will all of you think
about it?

241
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:20,820
We have one less rival.

242
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:24,760
This is our opportunity.

243
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:29,530
But Sotokoba-san might come.

244
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:32,400
He won't come.

245
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:38,240
He's working elsewhere now.

246
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:43,610
- What do you mean?
- So he won't come back here.

247
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:52,080
He will come back.
I'll go and call him.

248
00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:01,760
Hey! Don't do that.

249
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:06,370
I'm sure he wants to come
back. He's just holding out.

250
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:08,230
That's only natural.

251
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,950
He put an end to it.

252
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:14,310
<i>He drew the line as a father.</i>

253
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:22,210
That's what it means
to be a father.

254
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:27,150
Will you understand that?

255
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:32,620
What's wrong? You sound
like an ordinary parent.

256
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,700
Say...

257
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:45,070
You've changed.

258
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:47,740
I've just matured.

259
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:50,940
I hope I'm not the cause.

260
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:54,290
Don't put on an act.

261
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:56,750
I wouldn't want that!

262
00:21:57,350 --> 00:22:01,320
Oh, shut up. Go back
to work already.

263
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:09,760
What's up?

264
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,460
Koba-san was attacked?

265
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,770
When I came to see him
after my night shift,

266
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:23,170
he was lying unconscious
on the floor.

267
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:26,170
<i>He apparently had it out
with a group of thieves.</i>

268
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:33,200
<i>He had blood all over
his face.</i>

269
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,650
<i>Do you know what he said
as he was being transported</i>

270
00:22:35,650 --> 00:22:37,510
<i>on to the ambulance?</i>

271
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:40,210
<i>He doesn't want his family
to know about this.</i>

272
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:42,620
<i>He doesn't want them
to know what he does.</i>

273
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:46,660
When I heard that, it just
didn't seem right to me.

274
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:49,300
He's working there
for his daughter.

275
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:51,570
So how can she
not know about it?

276
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:53,170
I'm going over.

277
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:07,210
Excuse me.

278
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,940
Asami-chan! Marimo-chan!

279
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:13,750
So you both came to see me.

280
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:16,190
Was that the extent
of your injury?

281
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,020
You had blood all over
your face.

282
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:21,700
Oh, that?

283
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:24,730
When they cut my hand,
I must've panicked and

284
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:27,130
rubbed it all over my face.

285
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,140
You all look disgusted.

286
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:38,780
Can I ask you questions?

287
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,720
Come quickly.

288
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:50,760
- Aren't I the victim?
- That's right.

289
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:59,710
- I can't believe it.
- How can he show up here?

290
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:03,610
- I agree.
- The Manager must be upset.

291
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:07,490
- I would imagine.
- Those guys were terrible.

292
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:09,940
I hit the gasoline cans
as hard as I could...

293
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:12,650
but it had no effect.
So I panicked.

294
00:24:13,710 --> 00:24:17,220
You were lucky you got away
with a light injury as that.

295
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:21,220
That's a life-staking job.

296
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:24,870
So you're working
hard as a father.

297
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:26,760
Can you tell?

298
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,000
Aren't you going
to dance anymore?

299
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:36,400
A child is a parent's
soft spot.

300
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:39,890
Take Shinpei as an example.

301
00:24:39,890 --> 00:24:43,680
He went on his hands and
knees and asked Rintarô-kun's

302
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:46,820
father to acknowledge
his relationship to you.

303
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:49,610
When I saw that,
my heart was moved.

304
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:52,820
We're talking about
Shinpei here.

305
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:56,560
When I saw that, I felt
I couldn't lose to him.

306
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:01,630
Will you excuse yourself?

307
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:12,240
Why did you come here?

308
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:15,710
If you want to quit,
then that's fine.

309
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:18,780
But will you think about
their feelings, too?

310
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:21,810
Some were waiting for
you to come back.

311
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:24,690
I'm sorry. I asked him
to come here.

312
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:27,320
I'm sure you have your
reasons for quitting.

313
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,120
But when you did,
you rejected us.

314
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:32,460
Will you have some
consideration here?

315
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:34,490
I'm sorry. I'll leave
right away.

316
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,630
Are you really quitting?

317
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:43,100
Nakamori Ryûji
is coming tomorrow.

318
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:47,240
He's the producer for the
musical we applied for.

319
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,610
Let's dance together.

320
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:59,090
Good luck to all of you.

321
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:03,900
Hey!

322
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:09,070
I searched all over
for you!

323
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:14,610
You're not in bad shape!

324
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:18,340
- What're you doing here?
- He came to our house.

325
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:22,280
I heard you were
seriously injured.

326
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:25,500
So I couldn't let it go.

327
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:28,660
He told me what
your job entails.

328
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:33,830
Please don't mention
that at the wedding.

329
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,670
I'm going. I have to get
up early tomorrow.

330
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:44,800
Yôko, thanks for coming.

331
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:49,010
Wait a minute!

332
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:53,510
Your dad got injured.
Aren't you worried?

333
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:56,350
He's fine as you can see.

334
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:59,000
I was worried about him
so I went to the hospital.

335
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,750
But he wasn't there.

336
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:03,590
So I went to the police
station, and he wasn't there.

337
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:06,160
He was here.

338
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:10,860
Isn't this a pub?
He looks fine to me.

339
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:15,970
He did it for you.

340
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:21,340
What were you thinking when
you asked him to change jobs?

341
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:27,010
Sotokoba-san
told me before...

342
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:29,950
...that he wanted to work
at a job that he enjoyed.

343
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:34,850
It was his childhood
dream to dance on stage.

344
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:40,990
But he's working in a pitch
dark warehouse now.

345
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:45,400
- I feel sorry for him.
- Then he should just quit.

346
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:50,300
So you're making me
look like the bad guy.

347
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:53,910
Let's just drop it already!

348
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:57,200
Yôko-chan, don't get so upset.
You're a future bride.

349
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:00,850
You have to smile.
Just ignore what she said.

350
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:05,390
I think Koba-san is great.

351
00:28:05,390 --> 00:28:08,960
Yes, he is! He's living
for you, Yôko-chan!

352
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:13,190
He's already made up his mind.

353
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:17,130
So stop arguing already.

354
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:20,500
She's just being willful.

355
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,600
Stop it.

356
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,740
You have no right to rob
your father of his dream!

357
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:25,140
I said to stop it!

358
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:28,640
No... Sotokoba-san is
just weak.

359
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:32,410
Don't insult him any
more or I'll get mad!

360
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:34,110
He was just all mouth!

361
00:28:34,110 --> 00:28:37,070
That's not true! I wasn't just
mouthing off about my dream!

362
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:40,300
Yes, you were. Isn't that
why you ran away?

363
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:41,560
No!

364
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:45,230
You're gutless. So what if
your daughter is against it?

365
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:47,230
That's enough already.

366
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,630
Doesn't it ache your heart?

367
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:53,430
Tell me how it feels to
crush your father's dream

368
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:55,370
to make yourself look good.

369
00:28:55,370 --> 00:28:58,440
- Don't say it like that.
- That's insulting!

370
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:01,980
You should take a good
look at yourself before

371
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:05,150
- you dwell on his title!
- What do you mean?

372
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:07,610
Would you have fallen for me
if I was a Tôdai graduate?

373
00:29:07,610 --> 00:29:09,080
Don't insult me!

374
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,470
Stop trying to take
the easy way out!

375
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:15,520
What's with this place?
Am I the one at fault here?

376
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:19,230
He's the one who abandoned
his family to live as he pleased!

377
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:22,230
That's right. I'm to blame.

378
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:26,900
Don't let her control you.
It's unsightly.

379
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,840
He's trying to change.

380
00:29:31,610 --> 00:29:35,610
He has things to do that are
more important than his dream.

381
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:38,710
Don't you understand that?

382
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:41,680
Do you have the right
to condemn him for it?

383
00:29:42,350 --> 00:29:44,450
What do you mean by that?

384
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:47,020
Don't use your child
as an excuse.

385
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:52,660
Why did you go on your hands and
knees to Rintarô-senpai's parents?

386
00:29:54,930 --> 00:29:57,800
Did you think that would
do me any good?

387
00:29:58,170 --> 00:30:00,500
Is that what it
means to be a father?

388
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:07,240
I had my ideals
of a father, too.

389
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:13,650
When you suddenly appeared
in my life, I was shocked.

390
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,090
Because the father I was
idolizing, turned out to be you.

391
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:28,660
But you are you.

392
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,100
I was able to say what I want
because of who you represent.

393
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:41,880
You are more like a friend
to me than a father.

394
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:44,600
You're reckless but
you're warm-hearted.

395
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:47,150
And I liked you for your
warm-heartedness.

396
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:53,750
You do things that normal
people wouldn't do.

397
00:30:54,390 --> 00:30:56,690
And that's why I was
drawn to you.

398
00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:05,430
But if you're going to bow
down to his parents like that...

399
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:08,230
Then I could have had
someone else as a father.

400
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:15,310
I want to see you as you are.

401
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:38,830
You're right.

402
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,170
When I was a child, I used
to admire my papa.

403
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:50,210
It's always nice to keep
that image of one's father.

404
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:58,580
Please take a look at your
father's dream sometime.

405
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:03,190
It's pretty nice.

406
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,030
Thanks.

407
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:17,940
Thanks.

408
00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:22,800
I grabbed them from
the refrigerator.

409
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,880
That's bad.

410
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:31,050
I think Shinpei is just
feeling confused now.

411
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:37,890
He looked through
the travel magazines

412
00:32:37,890 --> 00:32:40,660
and bought those tickets
for the onsen trip.

413
00:32:41,430 --> 00:32:43,500
He's cute in what he does.

414
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:49,570
He's just trying to act
a bit mature.

415
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,940
Doesn't it bother you?

416
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:57,310
If I monopolize him.

417
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:05,990
I don't know what to say.

418
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,490
<i>Kanpai.</i>

419
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,800
Marimo-chan's words
sure hit me.

420
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:26,370
The back of a father, huh...

421
00:33:27,370 --> 00:33:32,340
Don't be weak-willed.
You're not wrong at all.

422
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:34,650
Let's have confidence here!

423
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:39,650
I'm upset! I could only say
half of what I wanted to say!

424
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:43,210
A father is living
for his family!

425
00:33:43,210 --> 00:33:45,730
He's killing his emotions
for his family!

426
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:49,480
Don't get depressed!

427
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,800
Shut up.

428
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:54,940
I'm worried about you.

429
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:58,190
You're bothering us, crybaby.

430
00:33:58,190 --> 00:34:01,210
He's right. It's not as easy
as you make it sound.

431
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:05,280
I don't believe you said that.

432
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:10,080
I'm mad! I'm going home!
I'm not hearing you out again!

433
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:13,490
Is that what you want?

434
00:34:18,530 --> 00:34:21,990
I'm going to stick it out
my style, after all.

435
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:28,740
Trying to adjust
my life to hers...

436
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:33,570
...was the beginning
of a life full of lies.

437
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:52,690
- No!
- I'm serious.

438
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:53,930
Why?

439
00:34:53,930 --> 00:34:57,460
I'm going to stop
acting cool.

440
00:34:57,460 --> 00:34:59,070
I don't understand it!

441
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:01,070
You don't have
to understand it!

442
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:03,700
That has nothing to do
with being a father!

443
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:08,150
As a father, I'm going
to struggle my hardest.

444
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:11,200
- But...
- I already made up my mind.

445
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,780
See you.

446
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:19,320
- I don't believe it!
- He's a big fool!

447
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:30,270
Don't be like him!

448
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:39,980
He's hopeless.

449
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:05,540
I'm sorry about the
other day.

450
00:36:06,170 --> 00:36:09,830
What are you doing here
in the morning like that?

451
00:36:09,830 --> 00:36:11,680
Can I say something?

452
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:15,780
What I said the other
day... was a lie.

453
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:21,060
<i>I'll try my best to be
accepted as her father.</i>

454
00:36:21,790 --> 00:36:26,330
<i>I'll even change my job.
I'll find a decent job.</i>

455
00:36:28,330 --> 00:36:32,030
I'm who I am. I can't be
someone I'm not.

456
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:35,470
You're truly upsetting!

457
00:36:39,810 --> 00:36:41,910
Take good care of Marimo!

458
00:36:42,310 --> 00:36:44,700
Sorry about the other time
when you left home.

459
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:47,510
You can come anytime.
You are always welcomed.

460
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:50,590
- Not in front of my father!
- Left home?

461
00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:55,690
You're in big trouble. One
day, he'll walk out on you.

462
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:01,830
Bye!

463
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:11,840
Are you up? Good morning.

464
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:14,210
Why didn't you come
home last night?

465
00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:17,400
The woman wouldn't let me go.
I'm very popular, you know.

466
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:20,680
Didn't I tell you to call me
if you're not coming home?

467
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,740
You're such a nagging kid.

468
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:25,520
I'm scared to be
home alone at nights.

469
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:29,260
I don't like being alone.

470
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:33,230
Don't leave me alone.

471
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:37,100
Eat.

472
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,370
I made rolled eggs and
beef with potatoes.

473
00:37:43,770 --> 00:37:46,020
You can compare them
with Asami-san's.

474
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:49,880
- What are you saying?
- You're blushing again!

475
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:58,820
Don't you want to go
to college?

476
00:38:02,090 --> 00:38:03,920
Don't hold back.

477
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:09,330
I wanted to go before,
but I'm not sure now.

478
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,430
Maybe it's because
I met all of them.

479
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:17,370
It's nice to have a dream.

480
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:22,440
I wonder what my dream is.

481
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:24,710
How would I know?
Figure that out yourself.

482
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:26,350
Don't be tight!

483
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:38,290
Don't brood over that.

484
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:44,680
- I'll push you.
- Wait.

485
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:46,730
Pick up the beat!

486
00:38:50,070 --> 00:38:52,540
Smile!

487
00:38:53,510 --> 00:38:57,050
- Stop!
- Don't stop them!

488
00:38:57,050 --> 00:39:00,420
That's not it!
Sotokoba-san will be here!

489
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:04,380
- Kôji, you have to be here.
- Kôji, get it right.

490
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:08,820
- We don't have much time.
- Will he really come?

491
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:11,100
There's only 30 minutes
to go before opening.

492
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:14,500
He may be a failure
as a family man,

493
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:16,960
but he's great as an
individual man.

494
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:20,070
He'll be here for sure.

495
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:25,340
He popped up here, chasing
after his childhood dream.

496
00:39:25,870 --> 00:39:28,180
He wouldn't easily...

497
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:33,280
Why are you holding
hands with Non?

498
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:38,550
I don't believe it.

499
00:39:39,090 --> 00:39:43,390
- When did that happen?
- Non-chan is blushing!

500
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:54,600
Can I come in?

501
00:39:56,570 --> 00:39:58,370
Welcome back.

502
00:39:59,910 --> 00:40:01,910
- I'm back.
- Sotokoba-san!

503
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:11,130
You smell like seawater!

504
00:40:11,130 --> 00:40:15,390
- You're soaking wet!
- I struggled a lot!

505
00:40:16,990 --> 00:40:19,930
- Manager! News!
- What is it?

506
00:40:19,930 --> 00:40:22,030
- I have a reservation.
- Who is it?

507
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:24,700
Natsu Mayumi-san!

508
00:40:27,070 --> 00:40:29,100
With the Morning Musume?

509
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:33,010
Wow!

510
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:40,310
We're in it for big time!

511
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:48,690
I want to join the
Morning Musume!

512
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:02,300
RESERVED SEATS

513
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:05,250
- Are they here?
- Not yet.

514
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:08,740
Aren't we up next? Are
they really coming here?

515
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:20,290
What's going on?

516
00:41:26,090 --> 00:41:28,130
Are they here?

517
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:45,080
Yôko, about my job...

518
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:48,050
This is my fiancé.

519
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:52,490
Thank you for always
being good to Yôko.

520
00:41:53,250 --> 00:41:55,420
Congratulations on your
upcoming wedding with her.

521
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:57,390
Pleased to meet you.
I'm Nonohara.

522
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:03,800
I'm... working here.

523
00:42:06,370 --> 00:42:08,970
You were great yesterday.

524
00:42:12,570 --> 00:42:16,540
You were desperately
trying to make your point.

525
00:42:19,450 --> 00:42:21,650
I want to see your dream.

526
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:34,460
- But...
- I'd like to see it, too.

527
00:42:38,170 --> 00:42:40,000
Thank you.

528
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:01,120
Welcome to the pub tonight.

529
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:07,430
I'm the manager, Okamoto.

530
00:43:11,030 --> 00:43:13,950
We have raw gems here.

531
00:43:13,950 --> 00:43:17,170
We have talented youths
and an old man.

532
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:22,140
I'm the manager, Okamoto.

533
00:43:23,010 --> 00:43:25,510
We have...

534
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:30,650
Forget him. Let's celebrate.

535
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:35,090
We have a couple here
who will be getting married!

536
00:43:39,790 --> 00:43:43,800
You have to grasp
your own happiness.

537
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:45,900
Yes.

538
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:38,700
I'm going to dance, too!

539
00:44:47,430 --> 00:44:52,030
- Take me to the onsen.
- Sure.

540
00:44:53,870 --> 00:44:56,000
I don't know where I stand.

541
00:45:08,050 --> 00:45:10,480
<i>I like his smiling face.</i>

542
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:14,590
<i>With him, I feel happiness.</i>

543
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:18,560
<i>I wonder if I should
start calling him Papa.</i>
