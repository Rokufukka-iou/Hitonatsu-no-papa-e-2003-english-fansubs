1
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,070
It's hot.

2
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:20,650
What's all this?

3
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:26,990
I feel sick.

4
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:43,570
Will you lock the door!

5
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:48,980
I don't believe this is
happening from the morning.

6
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:52,780
What's with you?

7
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:55,430
You open the bathroom
door then tell me to lock it.

8
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,320
Why should I get yelled at?

9
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,680
You should be the
one to apologize.

10
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,580
Will you lock the door
when you're using it?

11
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:03,090
Knock first before
you come in.

12
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:05,630
You came into my room
without knocking first.

13
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,000
How am I supposed
to knock on this?

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,630
Don't do to others what you
don't want done to you. Stupid.

15
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:13,270
Now I'm upset!

16
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,270
Will you be a little
more considerate here?

17
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:18,800
What's with all these
photos anyway?

18
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,270
I'm at a sensitive age!

19
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:22,860
These are so disgusting!
Don't leave them here!

20
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,750
They're for my job.

21
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:29,250
If they're so precious,
store them away somewhere!

22
00:01:30,950 --> 00:01:33,150
- What?
- What is it?

23
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:38,460
Aren't you conscious?

24
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:41,900
Isn't this making
you conscious?

25
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:44,570
Just clear them away!

26
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,840
Then do something
about that.

27
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,140
"That"?

28
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,040
Anybody can see that
we have one too many.

29
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:55,010
That's what Mama
and I used.

30
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:56,720
It's using electricity.

31
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,810
As I told you before,
I have no money.

32
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,190
Don't say it so proudly.

33
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:05,790
But I gave you the money
to go to prep school.

34
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,000
Don't talk big.

35
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,420
But I have every right
to talk big.

36
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:17,200
Marimo, it's hard
to earn a living.

37
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:20,600
We can't be wasteful.

38
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,510
You said these photos
are disgusting.

39
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:26,710
But I'm earning
a living with it.

40
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,180
Will you give it some
serious thought here?

41
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,100
Say...

42
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:50,500
So you didn't go
to prep school.

43
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:55,790
Were you planning
to pocket it?

44
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:57,900
Don't accuse me of that!

45
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:59,540
I raised the money to
send you to prep school!

46
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:01,710
- 300,000 yen, too!
- How can I possibly go?

47
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:02,840
Why not?

48
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,280
If you keep harping
about how poor you are,

49
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,710
how am I supposed
to feel about using it?

50
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:06,910
Don't act like a person
in poverty.

51
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:08,560
You're poor and you're
proud of it!

52
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,790
Shut up! You thief!

00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:10,830
Are you OK?

71
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:13,400
You looked depressed.

72
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:17,970
Tell me what's bothering you.

73
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:21,730
Well...

74
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:24,010
Why doesn't it come out?

75
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:26,220
Don't ask me.

76
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,789
You're responsible for the
cash as the cashier!

77
00:06:28,789 --> 00:06:30,244
What's the problem?

78
00:06:30,244 --> 00:06:31,950
The sales isn't matching
the receipts.

79
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:33,420
We're short by 15,000 yen.

80
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:36,630
Not that I want to suspect
someone, but I have to.

81
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,130
What do you mean?

82
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,330
Someone here stole it.

83
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:44,630
I don't know about that.

84
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:46,500
If you say that...

85
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,100
Why wouldn't it
be possible?

86
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:52,010
Am I being suspected?

87
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,957
Don't look at me like that.

88
00:06:56,957 --> 00:06:59,850
You and Marimo were
there, too, yesterday.

89
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:01,780
You were there, right?

90
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,500
- Yes.
- See.

91
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:09,023
I didn't take it.

92
00:07:09,023 --> 00:07:12,360
- I didn't take it, either.
- Manager, please believe us.

93
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:16,270
Everyone, here,
is responsible.

94
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:18,670
I'll have to think about
your wages this month.

95
00:07:18,670 --> 00:07:19,860
What!?

96
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:21,770
Are you going to take it
out from our wages?

97
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:23,370
- What did you expect?
- Why?

98
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:24,857
Don't complain!

99
00:07:24,857 --> 00:07:27,050
If you don't want that,
then look over yesterday's

100
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:29,150
receipts again to see if
there's any math errors.

101
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:31,050
Get to it!

102
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:33,480

Is that what you told her?

112
00:08:30,710 --> 00:08:32,610
I told her to think it over.

113
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,540
What did she say to that?

114
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:38,480
She made a face like this.

115
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,420
How cute.

116
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:45,337
Isn't that a laugh?

117
00:08:45,337 --> 00:08:47,560
And I have this much money.

118
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,690
That's awesome.

119
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:53,560
I'm scared of myself.

120
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:58,500
You should go independent.

121
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,650
You have extreme luck.

122
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:04,393
This is advice from God.

123
00:09:04,393 --> 00:09:06,280
This is your time of trail
and challenge,

124
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,440
now that you have a child.

125
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:11,150
It's your time to strive
your hardest.

126
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:12,810
Serious?

127
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,190
Here's your 60,000 yen.

128
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,090
I'm getting nervous here.

129
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:27,260
I'm going to open a savings
account for myself.

130
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,830

I'm number 55.

134
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:44,000
Number 55!

135
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,400
Yes!

136
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:56,120
Please fill this out.

137
00:09:58,190 --> 00:09:59,630
My name?

138
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:03,150
Do you want to know
my name?

139
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:05,300
Yes, please.

140
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:16,650
Do you believe in
God's advice?

141
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:21,820
I believed in it.
That is why I'm here.

142
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:37,530
Aren't I amazing?

143
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,440
This is a savings for
my girl and me.

144
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:51,950
Do I need to stamp my seal?

145
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,900
My seal?

146
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,900
- Yes.
- I see.

147
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,440
Give me the cash now!

148
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:51,810
All the customers are out.

149
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:13,100
The lunch hour sales
is 54,890 yen.

150
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,960
- Well?
- That's exactly what I have.

151
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:19,470
What's going on here?

152
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:23,910
Weren't you in front of the
Manager's desk yesterday?

153
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:34,150
<i>There's been an armed
burglary at the bank!</i>

154
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,990
Don't accuse me of it!

155
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:45,360
- Are you saying I did it?
- I'm saying it's not me!

156
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,830
But... Never mind.

157
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:53,257
- What were you going to say?
- Come out with it.

158
00:12:53,257 --> 00:12:55,700
You've been wearing
new clothes lately.

159
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:01,310
I can afford this much!
It was cheap!

160
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:04,550
Is it wrong to buy
new clothes?

161
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,850
Marimo is the one
with nice clothes.

162
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:09,750
Now that you've mentioned it...

163
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:14,020
These are all the clothes
I've had from before.

164
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:18,190
I haven't bought anything
new since I came here!

165
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:21,460
- Are you saying that it's me?
- I didn't say that.

166
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:24,170
- Is it me then?
- I didn't say that either.

167
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:26,200
Stop accusing each other.

168
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,470
Let's think this over calmly.

169
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:34,380
Who is the oldest person
here who is in dire need

170
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:37,080
of living expenses and
child support money?

171
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,980
Don't look at me!

172
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:43,820
- Sotokoba-chan.
- It's not me!

173
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,890
- I'll quit.
- What?

174
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:49,136
I don't want to stay here
after being accused.

175
00:13:49,136 --> 00:13:53,237
Not to say that the
hourly rate is low.

176
00:13:53,237 --> 00:13:55,130
I'm not getting much
for my dancing, too.

177
00:13:56,130 --> 00:14:00,140
- I'll find a job elsewhere.
- Wait a minute, Jun-chan.

178
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:02,540
It'll be hard to part
with you all, but...

179
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:05,210
What is this dance fee
that you're talking about?

180
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:09,380
It's the fee you get for
dancing at show time.

181
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:11,810
I haven't been receiving
anything for it.

182
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,780
Same here.

183
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,450
What's going on there?

184
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:22,590
I've been working at 820 yen
per hour for three years now!

185
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:25,160
820 yen?

186
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,760
Why do you sound
so surprised?

187
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:31,330
Do you have a higher
hourly rate than me?

188
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:33,130
A little.

189
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:34,940
Are you serious?

190
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:37,710
Marimo, how much do you get?

191
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,700
I get...

192
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,323
It doesn't matter, does it?

193
00:14:45,323 --> 00:14:48,350
- You don't have to say.
- It it higher than me?

194
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,550
How much are you getting?

195
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,520
850 yen.

196
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:58,630
I'm sorry!

197
00:14:58,630 --> 00:15:01,560
I was taking advantage
of you completely!

198
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:04,370
- I'm really sorry!
- Should it be like this?

199
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,700
Manager, do we really
need Marimo?

200
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:10,770
Before you think about
reducing our pay,

201
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:13,080
you should think about
things like that.

202
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,880
Let's calm down here.

203
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,910
If she leaves, you can
get a higher hourly rate.

204
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:22,250
We need Marimo!
She's our draw girl!

205
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:25,620
I thought we were
the draw girls.

206
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:28,680
- Are you picking a fight?
- You're not young anymore.

207
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:31,660
- You'd better cut it out.
- What's your problem?

208
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:34,700
- We need Marimo here!
- We don't need her!

209
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:42,900
This isn't looking good.

210
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:47,640
It really isn't.

211
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:52,710
I've become a problem here.

212
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,130
Part-time job?

213
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,370
Maybe I'll change jobs.

214
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:14,240
<i>They pointed the gun at the
female employee and ran off</i>

215
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,900
<i>with roughly 1.3 million
yen in cash.</i>

216
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:21,280
<i>The police are after these
two men for robbery.</i>

217
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:24,880
<i>There were many customers
in the bank at the time.</i>

218
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:26,850
I don't believe it.

219
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,350
What is he doing?

220
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,800
So he did that.

221
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:44,830
Let's hear what the
female employee has to say.

222
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:48,170
I thought he was
acting suspiciously.

223
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:51,070
Then he really did it.

224
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:54,410
I pressed the
emergency button.

225
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:58,850
I was really scared.

226
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:06,720
<i>We've spotted one of
the robbers on the run!</i>

227
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:18,930
Where did he go anyway?

228
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:28,340
Officer, my money is gone!

229
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:31,280
Find him, please!

230
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:33,850
Aren't you the bank robber?

231
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,580
No, it's not me.

232
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:04,850
<i>One of the robbers attacked
an officer and fled!</i>

233
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:12,690
Capture him!

234
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:20,860
Shinpei!

235
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:25,600
I guess he wouldn't
come home.

236
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,310
Shinpei!

237
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:30,927
- Where's Shinpei?
- He's not here.

238
00:18:30,927 --> 00:18:33,240
Asami-chan, you'll do.
Come! I need your help!

239
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:44,490
- What's going on here?
- It's the Manager's fault.

240
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:46,890
Why must I be treated
like this?

241
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:49,546
Why are the four of them
getting something and not me?

242
00:18:49,546 --> 00:18:51,264
I don't understand it at all.

243
00:18:51,264 --> 00:18:54,490
- Well, that's because...
- You needn't pay them.

244
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:57,270
- They're lousy anyway.
- Is that right?

245
00:18:57,270 --> 00:18:59,470
- How can you say that?
- I'm sorry.

246
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:00,900
I'm honest.

247
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:05,170
Damn guy! What a thing
to say to your senior!

248
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:16,450
I'm running away...

249
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:19,650
I guess I should be.
I punched that officer.

250
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:26,360
- I saw you on the news!
- Am I on the news?

251
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:29,000
What a face you had!

252
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,440
They've got it wrong.

253
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,940
The police misunderstood.

254
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:35,170
- Will you shelter me?
- Will you lend me money?

255
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:38,740
I have to pay for this
outfit by today.

256
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:41,310
But I used up all my
money on hand.

257
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:42,740
Don't you have
money on you?

258
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:45,180
- No, I don't.
- Didn't you rob a bank?

259
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:46,480
You've got it wrong.

260
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:50,697
Here's 10,000 yen.

261
00:19:50,697 --> 00:19:52,220
Hold this for me.

262
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:54,160
See you later.

263
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,930
I'LL SELL YOU INFORMATION

264
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:14,870
Do you have information
on the bank robber?

265
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,640
Will you sell it to me?

266
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:20,940
Information on the bank
robber? Sure.

267
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,180
What a savior!

268
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,410
You're fast as ever.

269
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,980
Pay me first.

270
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:34,220
Can I get a cigarette?

271
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,720
Pay me.

272
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:43,700
My money.

273
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:49,140
I don't have any now.
He ran off with it.

274
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:52,610
- I'll pay you later.
- Give me back my cigarette.

275
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:55,480
I want my money.

276
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,640
All right, all right.

277
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:01,750
Wait here.

278
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:12,060
What is Shinpei thinking?

279
00:21:12,490 --> 00:21:15,660
- He's a fool.
- He must be stressed out.

280
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:19,170
He must've wanted to
impress his daughter.

281
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:22,510
With a lot of money on hand.

282
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:24,970
He's a fool. I have no
room for sympathy for him.

283
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:40,220
Is it my fault?

284
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,120
Give me a break.

285
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:47,290
<i>This is a picture
of the culprits.</i>

286
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,030
Is he someone you know?

287
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:54,200
He's a very good boy.

288
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:57,500
But people can
change overnight.

289
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,840
So this is a town
with a criminal.

290
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:03,710
It's dangerous.

291
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:08,380
Is this where this
town is headed?

292
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,900
<i>(I can't hear you!)</i>

293
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,910
<i>When this masked man
took out his gun...</i>

294
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:10,610
<i>How embarrassing. I'm
a criminal's daughter.</i>

295
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,550
<i>Then he put down
the gun and fled.</i>

296
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:28,330
I'm going to leave
this place, after all.

297
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:52,950
Do we have any
money lying around?

298
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:56,590
- What are you doing?
- It's a misunderstanding.

299
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:59,650
Let me borrow that.
I'll return it later.

300
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:01,900
Give it back!
Mama left it for me!

301
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,650
I said I'll return it!

302
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:06,190
I don't trust you!
Give it back!

303
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:07,930
I haven't done anything!

304
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:12,210
I was thinking about our
future, so I went there.

305
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:18,780
I don't know how much
living expenses we need.

306
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:21,780
Or how much tuition or
allowance you need.

307
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,430
I have no concept
of how much I'll need.

308
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:26,250
So I thought if I had
some money set aside...

309
00:24:26,250 --> 00:24:27,840
- Do you have money set aside?
- No.

310
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,090
What's your point?

311
00:24:29,090 --> 00:24:30,660
So I went to the bank
for that purpose.

312
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:31,930
And rob the bank?

313
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:34,290
Stupid! I went there to
open a savings account.

314
00:24:36,530 --> 00:24:39,100
Then the robber popped
up on the side of me.

315
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,280
He had a gun on him.

316
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,040
He fled with our money.

317
00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:47,610
Our living expense money.

318
00:24:49,410 --> 00:24:51,210
I ran after him.

319
00:24:52,150 --> 00:24:54,410
But they thought
I was with him.

320
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,190
No one believes me.

321
00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:09,030
Please believe me.
I really didn't do it.

322
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:14,400
I'll swear to God...

323
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,570
I'll swear to you!

324
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:25,280
I can honestly swear to it.

325
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:34,090
Kirishima Shinpei, you're
under arrest for robbery!

326
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:37,790
- It's all a misunderstanding!
- Arrest him!

327
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:42,430
Marimo, I really didn't
do it! Believe me!

328
00:26:13,730 --> 00:26:15,290
Shinpei ran away?

329
00:26:16,430 --> 00:26:19,330
It'll be to his disfavor
in court.

330
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:23,400
But he didn't rob the bank.

331
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:27,770
How do you know that?

332
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,260
You saw the news,
didn't you?

333
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:31,910
That was definitely him.

334
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:35,350
I've decided to believe
in him.

335
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:43,620
I want to believe his words.

336
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:54,200
If he gets caught,
please help him.

337
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:59,710
I can't withdraw money
without the seal!

338
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:06,110
So you're going
to believe in him.

339
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,380
What do you all think?

340
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,760
I'll represent him.

341
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:24,030
I'm glad for you.

342
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:27,830
With Sensei on the case,
he's in good hands.

343
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:31,200
The fee is 200,000 yen.

344
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:41,210
You need money
for everything.

345
00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:46,220
Even if it means saving
someone who is right.

346
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:49,060
But I don't have the
money on me now.

347
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:51,220
That's my price.
Nothing less.

348
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:04,900
OK. I'll bring the money.

349
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:13,350
Sensei, why did you demand
such a huge amount from her?

350
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:16,580
She's just a child. And
she's Shinpei's daughter!

351
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:23,090
I wanted to test her.

352
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,200

357
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:52,650
Do you want money? I have
a good paying part-time job.

358
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:59,820
<i>How do I raise 200,000 yen?</i>

359
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:23,480
I'm doing an undercover
investigation.

360
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:26,650
It was my day off today.

361
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:28,110
When I got up around
noon, no one was home.

362
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:29,580
My wife and daughter
went out somewhere.

363
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:31,080
I wanted to spend time
with my daughter,

364
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,580
but she wasn't home.

365
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,350
There was only a cold plate
of curry over rice at home.

366
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:36,690
And I didn't want to eat
that on my day off.

367
00:30:37,390 --> 00:30:39,160
Then I started getting
upset inside.

368
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:43,260
What were you trying
to do there, Marimo-chan?

369
00:30:51,370 --> 00:30:52,670
Marimo-chan!

370
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,390
What should I do?

371
00:31:13,490 --> 00:31:15,730
Should I ask for an advance?

372
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,700
<i>WE'LL BUY YOUR UNNECESSARY
ELECTRICAL APPLIANCES</i>

373
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:38,350
Money matters are
important, but...

374
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:42,160
Manager, you're too sly.

375
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,420
What's wrong with me?

376
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:47,860
You shouldn't have
suspected your employees!

377
00:31:48,290 --> 00:31:53,500
What's wrong with worrying
about the missing 15,000 yen?

378
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:56,370
We're talking about money!

379
00:31:56,870 --> 00:31:59,470
- Will you raise my hourly rate?
- Mine, too.

380
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:01,470
We'll allot the missing
15,000 yen among ourselves.

381
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:04,440
Please give him the
same hourly rate as us.

382
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,580
Please raise mine, too.

383
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:08,720
That's right. This is
a money matter, too.

384
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,200
That's right, Manager.

385
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,980
So they're starting to
come to an agreement.

386
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:14,350
- As for Marimo...
- What is it?

387
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:15,760
They have an issue
with Marimo-chan?

388
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:19,930
You should let her go and
let us be the draw girls.

389
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:23,130
Will you be quiet, old hag?

390
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:27,440
- That's a low blow.
- Old hag?

391
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,170
Aren't you worried, too?

392
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:33,740
Aren't you the most affected
by Marimo-chan's presence?

393
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:38,210
- That's right!
- What about me?

394
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:41,780
- She just jumped.
- No, I didn't!

395
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:43,850
- She's defensive.
- She's panicking.

396
00:32:43,850 --> 00:32:45,420
We're not talking about me!

397
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:47,490
We're talking about
the hourly rate!

398
00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:49,790
- Go back to the topic!
- Manager!

399
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:55,660
- Asami-chan jumped at it.
- Shut up, old hag!

400
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:11,210
I wonder how much
I can get for all these.

401
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:28,730
Excuse me.

402
00:33:31,630 --> 00:33:34,100
Does Shinpei live here?

403
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:39,700
- Yes.
- I'm glad!

404
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:42,710
He's not home.

405
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:47,150
Did he get caught?

406
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:52,380
Not yet.

407
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:57,620
Will you return this to him?

408
00:33:58,890 --> 00:34:00,590
Shinpei is wonderful.

409
00:34:00,590 --> 00:34:02,330
He was on the run but
he lent me money.

410
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:03,630
That really helped.

411
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:11,270
- What's your name?
- And this.

412
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:15,940
Say...

413
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:20,480
Do you think Shinpei
committed the robbery?

414
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,100
No.

415
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,320
You're a great gal.

416
00:34:33,430 --> 00:34:35,390
You're super cute!

417
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:38,860
Catch you later.

418
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:47,840
What is she thinking?

419
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:02,520
You're going off the
topic of conversation.

420
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:06,510
- You're disturbed again.
- I'm not.

421
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:09,230
Are you more conscious
of Shinpei-san now,

422
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:11,700
with Marimo-chan around?

423
00:35:12,330 --> 00:35:15,530
- Your feelings are swayed.
- That's not true!

424
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:18,070
I think Shinpei is the
disturbed one.

425
00:35:18,910 --> 00:35:20,970
He wants to have his
fun with Asami-chan,

426
00:35:20,970 --> 00:35:23,510
but he wants to provide
for Marimo-chan.

427
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:29,150
The father in Shinpei
has awakened.

428
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:31,250
Shinpei-san, a father?

429
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:35,190
He's changed lately.

430
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:39,930
- In what way?
- Just here and there.

431
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:43,700
- You may be right.
- Right?

432
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:50,600
Do you think he stole
our 15,000 yen to cover

433
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,570
for his living expenses?

434
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:55,470
He wouldn't do that.

435
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:58,610
Don't ever say that again.

436
00:35:59,250 --> 00:36:01,650
He wouldn't steal
from his friends.

437
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:05,280
- I'm sorry.
- Stupid!

438
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:10,760
- Marimo-chan!
- What's up?

439
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,930
Did you hear that?
I meant no harm by it.

440
00:36:12,930 --> 00:36:14,570
Shut up.

441
00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:16,290
Don't let it bother you.

442
00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:17,900
How is Shinpei doing?

443
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:22,200
Well...

444
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:29,640
Will you lend me money?

445
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,510
Why?

446
00:36:34,210 --> 00:36:37,450
He's about to be
caught by the police.

447
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:41,350
But it's all from
a misunderstanding.

448
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:46,950
- Police? Was he arrested?
- Again?

449
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:50,070
That's what I came here
for in the first place.

450
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:54,070
- What am I doing anyway?
- What happened to Shinpei?

451
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,710
There he is!

452
00:37:00,370 --> 00:37:02,270
Will you come in quietly?

453
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,410
- Where's Konari-san?
- He's not here.

454
00:37:05,410 --> 00:37:09,320
- I brought the money.
- Oh, that?

455
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,220
It's the attorney fee
to save Shinpei.

456
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:14,150
How can you demand 200,000
yen from a high school girl?

457
00:37:14,850 --> 00:37:17,360
We all pitched in for it.
Count it!

458
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,860
Everyone went back to work.

459
00:37:28,970 --> 00:37:30,700
What are you going to do?

460
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:36,410
You don't feel like going?

461
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,880
I don't blame you.

462
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:46,120
Let's grab something to eat.

463
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:54,130
The lights are on.

464
00:37:55,830 --> 00:37:57,600
Is it a burglar?

465
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:17,350
Doesn't she have any
secret savings?

466
00:38:19,050 --> 00:38:20,690
Shinpei?

467
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:24,090
What are you doing!?

468
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:27,060
Will you lend me money?

469
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:30,350
I can't draw money
from it without a seal.

470
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:32,730
It made me jump when
the bank asked for a seal.

471
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:35,370
What's the matter?

472
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:38,770
Marimo?

473
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:42,270
What's wrong?

474
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:48,380
I was worried about you.

475
00:38:53,590 --> 00:38:56,360
I've been worried about
you all this time.

476
00:39:00,330 --> 00:39:02,690
I felt very lonely.

477
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:14,140
As a parent... don't make
me worry about that.

478
00:39:17,410 --> 00:39:18,640
Sorry.

479
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:23,350
Don't make me worry
about money matters.

480
00:39:26,690 --> 00:39:28,390
You're right.

481
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:32,500
I...

482
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:41,400
...was very, very...

483
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:49,840
Is the doctor in?

484
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:54,160
Will you treat me?
I'm in pain.

485
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,380
Hey!

486
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:57,320
Are you stupid?

487
00:39:58,120 --> 00:39:59,950
I remember this tattoo.

488
00:40:11,230 --> 00:40:13,430
We've found you!

489
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:15,630
Get him!

490
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:39,370
I'm glad you were cleared.

491
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,440
I'm upset! After all that
they beat me up,

492
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,540
all I get is a simple apology.

493
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:54,720
Marimo-chan,
please look after Shinpei.

494
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:57,690
What?

495
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:03,760
Why don't you
struggle a bit for her?

496
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,230
Instead of just waiting
around for work from me,

497
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:12,070
why don't you open your
own private eye office?

498
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:23,580
What is he talking about?

499
00:41:27,290 --> 00:41:29,620
Aren't you a private eye?

500
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:34,920
I'm an investigator.

501
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:39,800
Forget the details.

502
00:41:41,730 --> 00:41:43,330
I'm worried.

503
00:42:15,730 --> 00:42:18,140
Oh, no.

504
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:22,210
I saw that. Is that your
secret savings?

505
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:24,790
Manager, you shouldn't
hide your money there.

506
00:42:24,790 --> 00:42:26,480
You've got is all wrong.

507
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:28,680
I'm sending this money home.

508
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:54,300
Nice!

509
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:20,430
A parent can learn
from his child, too.

510
00:43:20,430 --> 00:43:24,030
I have an old story
to tell you tonight.

511
00:43:25,070 --> 00:43:28,240
A father who used to carry
his child across the river

512
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:31,410
was about to lose his sense
of direction from the strong

513
00:43:31,410 --> 00:43:34,480
<i>river currents. Then the
child on his back said,</i>

514
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:38,110
<i>"Dad, the shallow side
is on that side."</i>

515
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:42,850
<i>And that enabled the both of
them to cross the river safely.</i>

516
00:43:43,850 --> 00:43:46,860
<i>That was a lesson he learned
from the child on his back.</i>

517
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:50,130
<i>That's how the line,
"listen to your children" started.</i>

518
00:43:56,630 --> 00:44:01,610
A parent will mature with the
lessons he learns from his child.

519
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:06,010
We'll go into show time now!

520
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:32,030
<i>Trust isn't something
that you think in your head.</i>

521
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:36,470
<i>I think I somehow
realized that today.</i>

522
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:48,700
