1
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:19,180
They're having an
erotic conversation.

2
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:22,180
Open the curtains
and show me your faces.

3
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:26,046
<i>When I found out that he was
my papa, I wanted to die.</i>

4
00:00:26,046 --> 00:00:29,020
<i>But lately, I've been
thinking that he's not</i>

5
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:31,950
<i>all that bad.</i>

6
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:33,960
Shinpei, I brought
you food.

7
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,660
Thanks.

8
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:38,960
What is it?

9
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:45,370
It matches you.
You look great.

10
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:46,840
Think so?

11
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,770
You look good, too.

12
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:50,940
Do I look like the
typical private eye?

13
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:53,703
You do. You sure do.

14
00:00:53,703 --> 00:00:56,110
You have to be tough
to survive in this world.

15
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:58,850
You have to be kind or
you don't deserve to live.

16
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:01,620
Where were you yesterday?

17
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,750
I don't remember.
It's too long ago.

18
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:05,890
Can I see you tomorrow?

19
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:07,260
That's too far in the
future to...

20
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,020
The curtains are open!

21
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:19,130
We've got the scandal on
bureaucrat Munakata's wife!

22
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:24,940
This completes the job!

23
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:33,720
I don't see any attractive
guys around.

24
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:39,120
All the good ones
are already taken.

25
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:42,833
Satsuki, what are you saying?
You have Rintarô-senpai.

26
00:01:42,833 --> 00:01:46,390
Rintarô is in love
with someone else.

27
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:50,530
- Is that right?
- So we broke up.

28
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:56,070
<i>I've fallen in love
with you.</i>

29
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:58,170
That's terrible!

30
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:00,680
That's so rude!

31
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:05,310
Marimo? Your cell
phone is ringing.

32
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,500
It's me, Rintarô.

33
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,900
<i>I want to see you once more.</i>

34
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:27,170
When you slapped me in the
face with all your might,

35
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:31,110
it got me thinking.

36
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:36,580
I want to talk it out
with you.

37
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:38,510
But...

38
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:42,450
What is it?

39
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:47,150
Come out!

40
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:50,130
Let's see the dirty
exposures.

41
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,430
Is that you, Marimo?

42
00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:00,200
Don't open this door. I'm
developing pictures now.

43
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,640
OK.

44
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:11,910
What should I do?

45
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:17,490
They're developed.
Do you want to see them?

46
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:20,720
It's Kirishima Detective
Office's first job.

47
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,360
They have a love triangle
going on here.

48
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,430
She's having an affair
with her friend's husband.

49
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:38,340
She's a wretch for doing
such an immoral thing.

50
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:42,810
I know you can't stop love,

51
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:47,250
but you have to learn how
to control your feelings.

52
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:52,420
Don't ever become like her.

53
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:55,090
Why do you tell me that?

54
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,730
Didn't you just
get defensive?

55
00:03:57,730 --> 00:03:59,730
Are you stupid?
I wouldn't do such a thing!

56
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:02,830
You must be doing
something immoral!

57
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:05,670
The photos are disgusting!

58
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:09,040
What are you saying?
This is my job!

59
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:16,756
- Something smells.
- Get out!

60
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:20,920
He's sharp. He's seen
right through me.

61
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:28,460
<i>I have to control my
feelings or I'm a wretch?</i>

62
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:33,360
<i>Is this any summer
for a 17-year-old?</i>

<i>- You've reached Shinpei.</i>
- Shinpei, tonight...

80
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:36,340
<i>Kirishima Detective Office
is out on a job right now.</i>

81
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,930
Murderer.

82
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:12,610
Doctor, you shouldn't
be drinking so recklessly.

83
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:14,310
You're an adult.
Drink it more slowly.

84
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:18,210
- Sorry I'm not young.
- I didn't mean it that way.

85
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:23,860
Have you ever killed
someone before?

86
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:26,090
What?

87
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,300
That shut you up, didn't it?

88
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:34,910
Here, have a drink.

89
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:37,870
Here, eat.

90
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:40,870
Dr. Asami seems a bit
reckless in her drinking.

91
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:43,330
Maybe she's having
problems with her man.

92
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:48,160
Stupid. She must've had
a bad surgical experience.

93
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,820
She gets out of hand
when she's drunk.

94
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:54,870
- What happens?
- Well...

95
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:58,290
She kept us here till
morning the other time.

96
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:00,030
Till morning?

97
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,000
She even danced.

98
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:10,640
- She must be passionate.
- She danced the Latin.

99
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:16,940
Dr. Asami's great, isn't she?

100
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:18,710
She's pretty, smart,
and competent.

101
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:20,750
I want to be like her.

102
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,480
- She's the "dondon" type.
- What's a "dondon"?

103
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,590
She must've been good
at handling the men.

104
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:27,620
She seems to have
dated a lot of men.

105
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:29,620
She probably got every
man she wanted.

106
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:33,120
- She's the queen of love.
- "The queen of love"?

107
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:45,710
Maybe I'll ask her.

108
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:53,990
It feels good to work
for yourself.

109
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:57,180
It makes you feel
like a king.

110
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:01,050
Marathon runners
are awesome.

111
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:05,430
You don't see anyone griping
when they're running.

112
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:06,830
What brought that on?

113
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:10,240
You don't see anyone behind
them griping either.

114
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,330
Only the ones that retire
along the way make excuses.

115
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:20,140
Shinpei, don't become
one of the losers now.

116
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:25,680
You've started running.

117
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:30,580
So grit your teeth.

118
00:09:31,650 --> 00:09:33,190
OK!

119
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:35,760
Let's make a toast.

120
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:41,830
Do you really
understand what I mean?

121
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:48,430
Good night!

122
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,000
Hi.

123
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:54,640
- Are you running?
- Huh?

124
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,340
Are you gritting your teeth?

125
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:59,120
You should get a good
grip of the ground.

126
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,620
You sure like to pick
fights with me.

127
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:05,890
- Don't you like me?
- Good night!

128
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:08,890
- Marimo!
- What is it?

129
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:12,490
I got a picture of your
ugly face.

130
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:14,590
Did I look ugly?

131
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:16,330
Give it back to me!
It's my face you took!

132
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:17,560
No!

133
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,470
You can't just take my
photo without permission!

134
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:23,210
- Are you gritting your teeth?
- You're not making sense.

135
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:27,770
- Where were you yesterday?
- It's none of your business.

136
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:32,790
- Will you see me tomorrow?
- I see you everyday.

137
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:37,200
- Do you like me?
- What about you?

138
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,290
Of course I like you.

139
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:43,190
- In fact, I love you a lot.
- More than Asami-san?

140
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,630
You're too realistic.

141
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,860
Got you there.

142
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:56,440
I'm going out for more drinks.

143
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,040
He makes me tired.

144
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,510
Latin dancing...

145
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:07,340
Queen of love...

146
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:10,750
<i>I want to see you again
and talk it out.</i>

147
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:17,560
I'm in a bind.

148
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:36,810
But... she might laugh if I
confide in her about this.

149
00:11:37,510 --> 00:11:40,150
Is that right?

150
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:44,350
So you're brooding.

151
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,720
Is it over a man?

152
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,420
- It's summer now.
- Can you tell?

153
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:54,060
And the boy you like
is your friend's boyfriend.

154
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:56,000
Can you tell that, too?

155
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,770
- Did I get that right?
- So you were just guessing.

156
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:04,270
Will you tell me about it?
I'll be your confidante.

157
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:08,440
- It's really nothing.
- Hey! Tell me!

158
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:12,850
- Never mind!
- Why?

159
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:16,580
Never mind! It's nothing!

160
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:22,190
Done!

161
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:27,190
Perfect!

162
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:30,400
We just have to deliver
this to the client and

163
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,200
we get paid a million yen!

164
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:37,040
I'm so happy!

165
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:41,210
Hey!

166
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:43,870
Satoi-<i>mo</i>!

167
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:46,180
Looks like you're having fun.

168
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:49,650
This is a present for
your grand opening.

169
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:57,620
Satoi, will you bring
something better?

170
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:59,830
That's awfully blunt.

171
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:03,160
Well, it's from the
confidence I've gained.

172
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,100
Maybe it's the money.

173
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:08,400
Money? Don't get
carried away by it, fool.

174
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,440
We earned a million
yen in three days.

175
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:15,210
- Seriously?
- Wow!

176
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:18,610
I'm going to buy us a melon
instead of a watermelon.

177
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:20,950
Get a Yûbari melon.

178
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:25,520
So you said, you want
to eat a Yûbari melon.

179
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:28,550
And I don't blame you.

180
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,390
I'm going out to get it.

181
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,160
I don't follow.

182
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,800
You want us to search
for your former lover?

183
00:14:19,570 --> 00:14:21,610
She's our secretary.

184
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:28,080
And what are you
going to do?

185
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:32,720
- Do I have to tell you that?
- Well...

186
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,920
We want to make sure we're
not lending a hand in a crime.

187
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,860
That's right.

188
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:41,030
I want to ask her
to marry me.

189
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:43,600
So you're out to get her.

190
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:49,270
- The name first.
- Utsunomiya Shun'ichi.

191
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:53,770
- Not your name. Hers.
- Don't be nervous. Relax.

192
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:56,510
Inoue Asami.

193
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:01,080
Inoue Asami?

194
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:04,550
We were engaged before.

195
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:07,350
But we broke up because
of "that" incident.

196
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:09,400
What incident?

197
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:12,860
I realized how precious
she is, only now.

198
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,030
Is something wrong?

199
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,870
What happened with her?

200
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:27,670
- I'm curious, too.
- Please tell us.

201
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:36,520
I have a headache.
I drank too much.

202
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:43,560
I don't believe this.

203
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:50,000
- Good morning.
- Good morning?

204
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:56,870
Isn't is a surprise?
Nothing happened, right?

205
00:15:56,870 --> 00:16:00,370
You got that, right?
We have our clothes on.

206
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:07,420
I spent the night out
without telling my wife.

207
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:10,220
What am I going to do?

208
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:13,290
Wait!

209
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:15,760
Don't tell anybody
about this now.

210
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:18,860
Of course! I have a
family that I love!

211
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:20,830
What is that
supposed to mean?

212
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:24,400
Is that what's going
on between you two?

213
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,730
Is that right?

214
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:29,300
Adults have a lot of
secrets. Scary!

215
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:32,070
It's not what you think.
It's a misunderstanding.

216
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:34,210
It's really not what
you think.

217
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:36,380
So you're both
defending each other?

218
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:37,740
Is that right?

219
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:40,140
I said you've got it
wrong, damn hag!

220
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:43,380
Damn hag?
Hey! What was that?

221
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:46,020
You're getting paid
with our tax money!

222
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:48,320
What did you just say?

223
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:56,730
It's really not what
you think.

224
00:16:58,530 --> 00:17:00,900
You'll do.

225
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:04,640
I'm going to confide
in you.

226
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:09,040
Please help me with
my love problem.

227
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,310
Detective office?

228
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:16,220
Is this where she lives?

229
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:19,290
I'm going in.

230
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:23,360
What are you doing?

231
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,620
- Hello.
- Hi.

232
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:39,300
- What a surprise!
- Dr. Asami's former fiancé?

233
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:42,040
It's a problem, isn't it?

234
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:46,020
Should we tell Asami-chan
about it or not?

235
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:48,650
I said you should tell her.

236
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:51,250
If she finds out that
he's looking for her,

237
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:54,320
she might get
married to him.

238
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:58,900
- Then let her.
- Then Shinpei-san will be jilted.

239
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,730
Oh, I see.

240
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:05,120
- That's true.
- It's truly a problem.

241
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:11,260
Why did he break up with
Dr. Asami in the first place?

242
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:13,440
Weren't you listening to
what happened in the past?

243
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,510
No.

244
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,610
Then don't join in on
the discussion.

245
00:18:17,810 --> 00:18:22,060
He's actually my
friend's boyfriend.

246
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:26,320
To be accurate, he's
my friend's ex-boyfriend.

247
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:31,390
- The one who kissed you?
- Yes.

248
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:35,130
You seem to have a lot of
experience in these things,

249
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:37,300
so I came to seek your advice.

250
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:40,750
<i>It happened when she was
at the university hospital.</i>

251
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:43,440
<i>They had many emergencies
that particular night.</i>

252
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,010
<i>Excuse me. We have a request
to take an emergency patient.</i>

253
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:49,280
<i>A boy had fallen down the
stairs and hit his head.</i>

254
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,940
<i>Turn him away.</i>

255
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:54,410
<i>Take him.</i>

256
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:57,120
<i>And that emergency patient
was brought in.</i>

257
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,320
<i>Yûji!</i>

258
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:21,900
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

259
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:28,280
<i>I wasn't able to save him.
I'm very sorry.</i>

260
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,800
<i>Why did you say that?</i>

261
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:49,270
<i>He'll think that the hospital
made an inappropriate treatment.</i>

262
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:52,970
<i>A child passed away.</i>

263
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:56,810
<i>Don't talk about appearances
to me right now.</i>

264
00:19:57,410 --> 00:20:00,050
The hospital was sued by
Ishikura, the patient's family.

265
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:02,380
So Dr. Asami was forced
to assume the entire blame

266
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:05,520
- and was dismissed.
- That's awful!

267
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,650
So their engagement was
naturally called off.

268
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:09,590
That's harsh.

269
00:20:09,590 --> 00:20:13,530
Why is he looking for her
only now?

270
00:20:14,590 --> 00:20:18,300
He realized that he loved
Dr. Asami very deeply.

271
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:21,370
Then you shouldn't
tell her about it.

272
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:22,940
Stupid!

273
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:24,870
You just said she should
be told.

274
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:27,340
Shinpei is doing fine now
with his own business!

275
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:29,810
Having a rival like him
pop up now...

276
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:32,010
Don't talk like you know it
all, divorcée!

277
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:36,510
- What was that?
- She should be told!

278
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,170
Do I tell her?

279
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:43,720
If you love him, you
should tell her the truth.

280
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:48,670
- But he's Satsuki's ex-boyfriend.
- I told my friend's boyfriend.

281
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:52,900
- Not ex-boyfriend, but boyfriend?
- And I even went steady with him.

282
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:56,670
- What?
- That's what love is all about.

283
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:02,640
You knew that he was your
friend's boyfriend, but

284
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,780
you couldn't stop the way
you fell, right?

285
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:06,980
You didn't think you would
do such a thing,

286
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:11,120
- but your heart was moved?
- That's right.

287
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,320
- What is it?
- You're experiencing real love.

288
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,290
Do you think so?

289
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:21,390
Friendship is important,
but so is love.

290
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:25,360
I feel encouraged, talking
to you.

291
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:27,900
You have a nice smile.

292
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:33,470
You should turn off your cell
phone in a restaurant.

293
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:37,210
Shall we go?

294
00:21:37,210 --> 00:21:39,410
I'll be at the clinic.

295
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:50,490
Murderer.

296
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:53,660
Hello? Kumiko?
What's up?

297
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:57,130
I heard Rintarô-senpai is
in love with you.

298
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:01,770
<i>That's what he told Satsuki.</i>

299
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:09,070
<i>I'm really sorry. I've
fallen in love with Marimo.</i>

300
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:15,810
Is that right?

301
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:18,950
Don't act dumb.
Didn't you kiss him?

302
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:21,250
It's not what you think.

303
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:25,590
Are you going to choose
friendship or love?

304
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:28,930
Friendship, of course.

305
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:31,800
Can you tell that to Satsuki?

306
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,870
Of course.

307
00:22:34,870 --> 00:22:38,000
We'll be waiting at Daisan
Park at 3:00.

308
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,810
I don't believe this.

309
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:49,380
I should choose friendship,
after all.

310
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,380
Asami-san is different.

311
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:59,220
I can't tell Satsuki I want
to be with Rintarô.

312
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:03,530
Asami-san, I'm going.

313
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:06,730
- Marimo-chan, run!
- What?

314
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:17,340
You're terrible. Bringing
that cute kid here.

315
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:21,890
He's a bad boy. He was
loitering in front of my office.

316
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:25,180
I thought he'd do better
with someone closer to his age.

317
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:27,670
How cute! So you're worried.

318
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:30,290
It's better to get it off
his chest.

319
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:33,060
Refer him to someone good.

320
00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:36,760
It would be great to have
a papa like you.

321
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:39,700
Don't you think so?
I think so myself.

322
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:41,900
But Marimo just doesn't
get it.

323
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:44,870
Did you see anybody
you like?

324
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:46,670
Her!

325
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:50,640
You have good taste.

326
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:54,070
I feel refreshed!

327
00:23:54,070 --> 00:23:57,380
Is the next customer here?
I'll be leaving now.

328
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:05,190
- Nasty.
- Do you know each other?

329
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:08,360
- You dirty old man.
- Hoshino-san is a regular.

330
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:12,230
- Is that right?
- It's not what you think.

331
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:14,830
I stayed out all night,
so my wife won't let me

332
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:16,270
into the house.

333
00:24:16,270 --> 00:24:18,600
No wonder your daughter
went delinquent.

334
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,210
When I woke up, it was
already morning.

335
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:21,840
You're a bad officer.

336
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,440
I sweated a bit so I came
here to take a shower.

337
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,050
Go to a bathhouse.

338
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:28,780
I was shocked to wake up
next to Dr. Asami.

339
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:32,850
- Too bad nothing happened.
- Did you just say, "Asami"?

340
00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:36,420
- Did you sleep with Asami?
- I have such loose lips.

341
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:38,260
Damn you!

342
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:40,730
How could you sleep with
my Asami!

343
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:43,130
You hit an officer three times.

344
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,100
I'm not talking to you anymore!

345
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:48,670
We shouldn't let
Shinpei-san know.

346
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:53,420
- He'll be bedridden.
- We should tell him.

347
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:56,390
That's only natural.
It's a job.

348
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:59,340
Don't let personal feelings
influence your work.

349
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:02,540
But it can't be avoided
in this particular case.

350
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:05,120
It's that kind of attitude
of yours that makes you

351
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,650
incompetent at work
and in your dancing.

352
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,660
Why is he so cocky?

353
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:21,030
I'm sorry. He just acts
big to people he knows.

354
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:26,400
- He has a cold heart.
- Freezing cold!

355
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,340
You must not be well-liked.

356
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:31,620
There are things that
you shouldn't say.

357
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:34,950
Sato-<i>imo</i>!

358
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:37,480
I'm going to sue you
for slander!

359
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:40,190
- Where's Shinpei?
- What's wrong?

360
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:42,620
Marimo-chan's
been kidnapped.

361
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:44,360
What? Marimo?

362
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:46,360
I'll check to see if he's
in his room.

363
00:25:49,330 --> 00:25:53,430
- Darn...
- Excuse me.

364
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:55,970
I have nothing to do
with this, do I?

365
00:25:55,970 --> 00:25:57,900
Shut up!

366
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,490
Shinpei-san isn't back yet.

367
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:14,840
He's not answering his
cell phone, either.

368
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:18,180
- What is that fool doing?
- I'm going to look for him.

369
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:20,370
Do you know where he is?

370
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:22,080
If you don't, don't run
about aimlessly!

371
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,080
It won't do us any good
to stay here.

372
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,220
Call the police!

373
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:29,550
But what if Dr. Asami's
past comes to light?

374
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,420
What is she loses clients?

375
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:38,970
I'm going to check all
the places he may be.

376
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:41,630
Me, too.

377
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:44,140
Manager, stay here and
watch the place.

378
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:46,340
Be careful.

379
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:49,410
Dr. Asami, stay here.

380
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:02,750
He's not here.

381
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:17,100
- Did you find him?
- Where did everyone go?

382
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:34,890
Let's have faith in everyone.

383
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:37,220
I'm sure Shinpei will
come through.

384
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:44,560
- Satoi-san?
- I'm going out.

385
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:49,900
Shinpei-san,
don't misunderstand.

386
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:54,690
Nothing happened.

387
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:58,110
- Go away, pervert cop!
- Don't say that.

388
00:27:58,110 --> 00:28:00,010
Shinpei!

389
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:06,720
I have something to tell
you about this pervert cop.

390
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,850
Come with me.

391
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:10,920
Hurry.

392
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:37,480
Damn!

393
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,500
I...

394
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:47,160
What is it?

395
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:53,630
I have to meet Satsuki and
Kumiko at 3:00.

396
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:58,840
Shut up. Are you in any
position to be saying that?

397
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:03,340
Don't take me lightly!

398
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:11,110
Why? Why is that woman
practicing medicine?

399
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:13,270
She killed my child!

400
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:15,550
How can she continue?

401
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:20,730
I heard the details
from Satoi.

402
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:22,990
Shinpei, I'm sorry to pull
her into this.

403
00:29:22,990 --> 00:29:27,270
- Where does he live?
- He wasn't at home.

404
00:29:27,270 --> 00:29:29,570
Ishikura got a divorce
earlier this year because

405
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:31,840
of the constant bickering
he had with his wife after

406
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,610
their child died. And
he's unemployed.

407
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:35,510
He's trying to get
revenge on Asami.

408
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:37,180
The police think so, too.

409
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:39,540
Police? Did you go to
the police?

410
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:42,950
- I told him to.
- Why did you do that?

411
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:45,220
Marimo-chan's life is on the
line here!

412
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:53,760
Marimo!

413
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,270
Is that you, Ishikura?

414
00:30:03,230 --> 00:30:07,640
- Please return Marimo.
<i>- Is Inoue Asami there?</i>

415
00:30:09,870 --> 00:30:13,480
- She's not here.
<i>- No!</i>

416
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:15,710
What are you doing?

417
00:30:15,710 --> 00:30:20,220
Tell her that she killed
my son.

418
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:25,790
I'll let her have a taste
of what I suffered.

419
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:29,760
The pain of losing
a loved one.

420
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:37,300
This is Inoue. Marimo-chan has
nothing to do with this.

421
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:38,970
Please let her go.

422
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:42,510
Shut up! I'll kill your
friends one at a time.

423
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:45,280
<i>I don't want to die.</i>

424
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:48,250
Ishikura-san, please stop.

425
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:50,850
Then kill yourself and
make amends!

426
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:57,590
Die in a grand manner and
make tomorrow's news!

427
00:30:57,590 --> 00:31:00,120
Can you do that?

428
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:05,460
You cut me.

429
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:08,330
- You really cut me!
<i>- Marimo-chan!</i>

430
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:13,000
Ishikura! What did you do
to Marimo!? I'll kill you!

431
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,510
- Calm down!
- Let me hear Marimo's voice!

432
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:20,580
- Calm down!
- Let me hear her voice!

433
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:22,650
Do you know who you are
talking to?

434
00:31:22,650 --> 00:31:26,020
Shut up, fool!
Let me hear her voice!

435
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:28,990
Don't yell into the receiver!

436
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:31,720
I'll let you hear her voice.

437
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:34,230
Remember her words well.

438
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,500
Hello?

439
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:45,600
- Marimo? Are you OK?
- He cut my face.

440
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:50,940
If I'm unpopular, it'll
be your fault.

441
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:52,880
Where are you?

442
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:56,500
I don't want to die.

443
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:59,850
Don't worry. I promise
I'll save you.

444
00:32:03,790 --> 00:32:06,820
Everyone has unlucky days.

445
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:11,400
But this is the worst day
for me.

446
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:16,630
Mama died.

447
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,740
Then you became my papa.

448
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:26,980
When I found out you were
my papa, it was the pits.

449
00:32:28,010 --> 00:32:31,050
But today is even worse.

450
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:41,390
Never mind that. Where
are you now?

451
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:47,630
- Near Mama.
- What?

452
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:52,270
When you're sad...

453
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:58,110
Why do you want to be
with the ones you love?

454
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:05,980
Shinpei!

455
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:13,120
Ishikura!

456
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:17,990
Hurry and find her, Satoi!

457
00:33:17,990 --> 00:33:20,400
Marimo-chan's life
is on the line!

458
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:25,900
Where are you now?

459
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:30,440
OK!

460
00:33:57,070 --> 00:33:59,740
Marimo-chan is somewhere
around here.

461
00:34:02,370 --> 00:34:05,410
Was that your dad?

462
00:34:09,850 --> 00:34:12,680
He suddenly shows up
in my life.

463
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:20,990
We've only been together
for a month.

464
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:29,970
But we're trying our best
to be father and daughter.

465
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:40,910
He sounded desperate.

466
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,620
What?

467
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:50,120
He really did.

468
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:59,430
<i>Hang in there!</i>

469
00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:03,420
<i>Yûji!</i>

470
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:06,500
<i>Please save him!</i>

471
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:11,710
I was desperate, too...
that night.

472
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:19,420
But he didn't make it.

473
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:30,090
<i>Yûji!</i>

474
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:38,600
I know I'm wrong for
hating the doctor.

475
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:51,080
But I was working till
late every night,

476
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:56,520
and I couldn't even play
with him on my days off.

477
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:01,230
Then I lost my job.

478
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:07,330
I didn't do anything for
Yûji for seven years.

479
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,380
Marimo!

480
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:28,920
- You pervert!
- Stay away!

481
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:33,090
How dare you cut her face!

482
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:35,790
As a parent, you should
know how I feel!

483
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:38,330
Why did you hurt my Marimo?

484
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:42,270
Don't beat around the bush!

485
00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:45,770
"When you're sad, you want to
be near your loved ones."

486
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:47,910
Just say that you're by
his son's grave.

487
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:50,910
- I really had to think about that.
- So you figured out.

488
00:36:50,910 --> 00:36:53,510
Well, she couldn't just
come out and say it!

489
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:58,240
- Isn't that right, Marimo-chan?
- Did you set me up?

490
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,850
I don't want to die.

491
00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:03,590
Ishikura-san!

492
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:13,200
His chance of survival
was only 0.1%.

493
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:20,500
But I didn't want to give
up on him.

494
00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:26,110
It wasn't as if it was
completely hopeless!

495
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:30,810
I really wanted to save him!

496
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:38,320
Ishikura-san, I can't die.

497
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,560
I won't stop practicing.

498
00:37:43,830 --> 00:37:46,930
I want to save as many
people as possible.

499
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:17,130
So I can't do as you say.

500
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:19,260
Doctor...

501
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,670
I'm sorry.

502
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:36,250
- What are you doing?
- Ishikura-san!

503
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,400
This should do it.

504
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:08,620
Are you all right?

505
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:12,590
It was pretty tiring.

506
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:15,820
For you.

507
00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:22,800
- It's a Yûbari melon.
- Thanks.

508
00:39:24,770 --> 00:39:27,440
I've never seen you like that.

509
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:30,400
You were desperate.

510
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:34,840
I have to be serious
sometimes.

511
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,150
If I ever get taken
as a hostage,

512
00:39:38,150 --> 00:39:41,050
will you save me with
a serious look like that?

513
00:39:43,350 --> 00:39:45,140
What is it?

514
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:49,220
It's you, isn't it?
Of course.

515
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:14,110
It must've been scary.

516
00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:25,660
While you can still feel
the pain, you're fine.

517
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:30,030
Pain is the hope in life.

518
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:34,500
When you stop feeling pain,
then you're over the edge.

519
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:40,210
What a shock. That's what
my mama used to say.

520
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:45,550
She was a nurse and she used
to tell her patients that.

521
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:57,060
I heard it from a certain
nurse myself.

522
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:59,830
You're stealing her line then.

523
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:05,830
Do you feel pain?

524
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:11,000
I was just thinking...

525
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:17,680
What is my hope?

526
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,920
I was afraid of being tied up.

527
00:41:25,290 --> 00:41:27,720
I was afraid of being hurt.

528
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:32,660
I was afraid of everything.

529
00:41:34,830 --> 00:41:37,700
Maybe I had faith...

530
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:44,500
...that he would come
to save me.

531
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:49,690
That's father and daughter
for you.

532
00:41:49,690 --> 00:41:54,010
He's more like a friend to me.

533
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:05,520
That'll heal in no time.

534
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:08,630
You took too long.

535
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:11,300
What are you saying?
My timing was perfect.

536
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:14,030
If it leaves a scar, I'm
going to sue you.

537
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:20,370
Don't worry, it'll go away.

538
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:25,600
How is he doing?

539
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:28,050
He's going to the police
hospital.

540
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:34,050
- This is for you.
- Thanks.

541
00:42:34,050 --> 00:42:38,290
- What about me?
- Don't be tight.

542
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:10,140
Who's that?

543
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:13,430
Asami-chan's former fiancé.

544
00:43:13,430 --> 00:43:15,400
Fiancé?

545
00:43:19,770 --> 00:43:22,200
Poor thing.

546
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:50,600
- Hi.
- I don't believe it.

547
00:43:58,170 --> 00:44:00,560
Why didn't you come?

548
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:03,410
Oh, that's right! I'm sorry.

549
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:06,850
Rintarô?

550
00:44:07,510 --> 00:44:09,680
It was pure coincidence.

551
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:13,620
- Is that what's going on?
- No, it's not what you think!

552
00:44:27,030 --> 00:44:30,140
Will a love that started
at the bottom of the sea

553
00:44:30,140 --> 00:44:32,770
disappear with the foam of
the sea or turn into the

554
00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:38,410
blazing summer sun? We're
having a love scramble tonight.

555
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:39,540
<i>My summer was definitely
moving forward.</i>
