1
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,100
<i>What's going
to happen to Marimo?</i>

2
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,470
<i>She can't stay with me.
I have no spare room.</i>

3
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:33,740
<i>Can she stay at the
dorm for a while more?</i>

4
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,310
<i>By policy, I can't allow a
person without a guardian,</i>

5
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:39,210
<i>that's a high school
student, live there.</i>

6
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,450
Are you going to kick
her out then?

7
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:43,990
Don't put it like that!

8
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:45,190
Wait!

9
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:47,200
MOCHIZUKI FAMILY GRAVE

10
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:02,530
Stop the music!

11
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:06,440
Sotokoba-san!

12
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:09,970
- Why don't you quit?
- What?

13
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:11,610
Why don't you quit this job?

14
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:13,080
Now, now.

15
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,340
You're slowing
down everyone.

16
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:18,180
Stop smiling!

17
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:20,980
Put your all into it!

18
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,990
Excuse me.

19
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:30,200
Lunch hour is over.

20
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,600
What?

21
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:34,830
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

22
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,856
Everyone is...

23
00:02:36,856 --> 00:02:38,970
- Excuse me.
- What is it?

24
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:41,870
Well... I'm...

25
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:46,480
I don't believe this!

26
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,950
Shinpei-san!

27
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:00,990
Shinpei has a daughter?

28
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,500
KONARI LAW OFFICE

29
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:12,570
Sensei!

30
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:13,987
Where's Sensei?

31
00:03:13,987 --> 00:03:17,210
Knock before you come in!
Have you no manners!

32
00:03:17,210 --> 00:03:18,620
Is Sensei around?

33
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:20,980
Don't visit him like a friend.
He's a busy man.

34
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:23,880
And he's too expensive for
you to afford for counseling.

35
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,850
- Leave!
- That hurts!

36
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:28,380
You're aggravating me, Satoi.

37
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,090
- Not Satoi-san?
- You're younger than me.

38
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:32,990
I have a better paying
job than you.

39
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:34,720
You're just a part-timer
like me.

40
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,030
You can't even get
your law license.

41
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:39,390
You've got the gall!

42
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:41,000
Out of my way!

43
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:42,970
Sensei!

44
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:44,300
You're making
too much noise.

45
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,540
Do you know
where Shinpei is?

46
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:49,670
He's probably at the rooftop.

47
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,400
Excuse me.

48
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,060
Shinpei!

49
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:06,970
Why don't you
get a tan with me?

50
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:08,610
The girls will like it.

51
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:10,950
Your daughter is here.

52
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:12,314
What?

53
00:04:12,314 --> 00:04:13,840
Your daughter.

54
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,610
Daughter?

55
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,200
- How old are you?
- Seventeen.

56
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,500
Are you a junior
in high school?

57
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,500
Senior.

58
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,000
Are you really
Shinpei's daughter?

59
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:25,160
I guess you are.

60
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,660
You wouldn't come
here as a joke.

61
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:29,613
What's your name?

62
00:04:29,613 --> 00:04:31,160
Mochizuki Marimo.

63
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,559
She has a different
last name as Shinpei.

64
00:04:34,559 --> 00:04:36,014
Must be serious.

65
00:04:36,014 --> 00:04:37,670
What else can it be?

66
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:44,440
Here.

67
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:57,990
My mama passed away
two weeks ago.

68
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:01,060
See! I was right!

69
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:07,000
What kind of person
is Kirishima Shinpei-san?

70
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:08,930
Well...

71
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:14,470
- Married?
- Asking me?

72
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:16,670
- Why would I ask you?
- He's not.

73
00:05:16,670 --> 00:05:18,610
He's a bachelor.

74
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,057
She's curious about him.

75
00:05:22,057 --> 00:05:23,550
What does he do?

76
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:27,650
Well... I guess you could
say he's a private eye.

77
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,250
Private eye...

78
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:35,030
That sound neat.

79
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,900
- He's here.
- Shinpei-san!

80
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:50,040
Shinpei, she's your daughter.

81
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,410
Her name is Marimo-chan.

82
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,910
My daughter?

83
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,823
You can't be serious.

84
00:05:58,823 --> 00:06:00,450
It came as a big surprise.

85
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,060
My daughter?

86
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:34,980
Are you my daughter?

87
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:40,950
That's harsh.

88
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:42,750
What?

89
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:45,950
That's a harsh joke.

90
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:49,520
Shinpei, what are you doing?

91
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:55,100
What bar are you from?

92
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,900
That hurts!

93
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,370
Don't take me lightly!

109
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,210
Who's this?

110
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:10,210
He's suing our client,
Dai-Nippon Keizai Shôkô Gaisha.

111
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,180
Tanigawa Ichirô, 41.

112
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:14,450
He's suing for
wrongful dismissal.

113
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:18,160
Oh, it's a case of an
unjustified resentment.

114
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,820
It's a pending lawsuit.

115
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:22,124
He has a high chance
of winning now.

116
00:09:22,124 --> 00:09:24,960
The company who fired
him will then lose face.

117
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:27,703
Then he had a justified case.

118
00:09:27,703 --> 00:09:30,400
President Kusunoki thought
Tanigawa in accounting

119
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:33,100
found out about his illegal
dealings so he fired him.

120
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,520
Is that what he was doing
behind the scenes?

121
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,540
But Tanigawa knew
nothing about it.

122
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:40,110
He doesn't understand
why he was fired.

123
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:43,880
He's suing to save his pride.

124
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:48,450
And it all started with the
president's misunderstanding.

125
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:50,760
But we can't afford to lose.

126
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,220
That's true.

127
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:54,790
Shut up! Stop making
comments in between.

128
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,650
What's with your attitude?

129
00:09:57,650 --> 00:09:59,110
Stop acting like a smarty pants.

130
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:01,490
Just find out his weakness.

131
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:03,570
That should be easy. Go.

132
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:05,660
Don't order me around.

133
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:11,540
It's noisy.

134
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,340
Welcome back.

135
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,600
Shinpei.

136
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,150
What did you find out?

137
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:30,490
Have a seat.

138
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:36,430
She's who she claims to be.

139
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,830
Do you remember
Mochizuki Yukino?

140
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:46,840
The nurse that tended to you
when you were taken to the

141
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,770
hospital at age 21,
for an injury in a fight.

142
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,440
She's your daughter
from that time.

143
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,880
Are you serious?

144
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:05,520
In case something happened
to her, she left your name.

145
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:20,870
Just accept it already.

146
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:29,640
- Give me a break.
- My sympathies.

147
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,720
Your past has caught
up to you.

148
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:33,730
Get to work.

149
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:35,790
You have to work hard
for your child.

150
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:37,420
When you get the job
done, I'll pay you.

151
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:40,690
Not like you're paying me!

152
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:16,370
Tanigawa Ichirô...
Nakano 7-chôme, Nakano-ku...

153
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,990
It's nearby.

154
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:38,260
Open quickly...

155
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:59,010
Where is it?

156
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:07,620
Where's the public
document?

157
00:14:50,710 --> 00:14:52,310
Yukino...

158
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:35,050
What are you doing?

159
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,030
Don't scare me like that!

160
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:39,320
How did you get in?

161
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:41,490
Get out!

162
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,370
The door was open.

163
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:45,930
Just get out!

164
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,730
That hurts!

165
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:05,180
I'm not going to register
you as my daughter!

166
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:10,790
Another thing...

167
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:13,360
I don't have money!

168
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:16,060
I can refer you to a
part-time job, though.

169
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,500
The door was open!

170
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,640
It really was!

171
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:32,380
How is it?

172
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:35,780
What do you mean?

173
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:42,520
Let's just accept reality.

174
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:45,200
We can't live together.

175
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,290
You wouldn't want that,
anyway, would you?

176
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:52,200
I may be able to provide
some financial support,

177
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:55,000
but not entirely.

178
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:58,840
In other words, you...

179
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:04,840
Don't say "you."
I have a name. Marimo.

180
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,950
You're such a sassy kid.

181
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:11,550
This is stupid.

182
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,820
To think you're my papa.

183
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:18,030
Why am I your daughter?

184
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:19,930
Not like I wanted to be
your father!

185
00:17:19,930 --> 00:17:22,660
How can you say that
in my face!

186
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:26,860
Mama, he's the worst.

187
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,700
You have no eye for men.

188
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,800
What father would
kiss his daughter!

189
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,760
It's normal in America.

190
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,260
Aren't you Japanese?

191
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:37,600
I'm actually an American.

192
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,000
- And you're poor.
- You know...

193
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,200
You said you didn't
have any money.

194
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:45,100
- That is because...
- You seem loose with women.

195
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,600
What do you expect?
I'm a bachelor.

196
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,700
- You seem unintelligent, too.
- You got that right!

197
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,300
And you look scary.

198
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,790
I took after my mother.
Get off my case.

199
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,600
I want to see Grandma.

200
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,790
- Go to Heaven!
- What about Grandpa?

201
00:17:57,790 --> 00:18:00,380
- He's somewhere.
- What kind of answer is that?

202
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:02,700
He left us when I was
four years old.

203
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:04,430
Just like me, then.

204
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:11,970
What is it?

205
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:13,940
I won.

206
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,800
TANIGAWA

207
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:18,320
<i>Papa, are you done?</i>

208
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:21,490
<i>If you're not going to eat,
I want to clean up.</i>

209
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:25,600
<i>Just forget about the lawsuit.</i>

210
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:29,690
Will you go out and work?

211
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:31,450
Will you bring home money?

212
00:19:31,450 --> 00:19:32,900
Will you provide for us?

213
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:37,380
I know. But I'm having
a battle of my life now.

214
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:39,310
Why do you bother with that?

215
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:41,980
So what if you're fired?

216
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:44,220
Let the past go.

217
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,950
Face reality.

218
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:47,790
Work for your family!

219
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,630
Family, huh.

220
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:16,280
Forget this.

221
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:20,180
I'm calling it a night.

222
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,770
What are you doing?

223
00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:00,370
Stop it.

224
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:06,410
Is that how it should be?

225
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,910
OK, OK. I'll drink, too.

226
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:14,780
I'll have another.

227
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:21,620
Why do I have a kid
when I'm a bachelor?

228
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,290
I don't understand it.

229
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:31,830
So I want to be
with you tonight.

230
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:37,040
I want to go to your
place tonight.

231
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:42,640
You really didn't know?

232
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:45,750
That you had a child?

233
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:48,920
Of course I didn't.

234
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:54,290
She must've really loved you.

235
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:08,600
Thanks for waiting!

236
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:14,840
My daughter yelled,
"Damn old man!" to me.

237
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:20,150
She's at a defiant age,
isn't she?

238
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:25,020
I'm busy right now.

239
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:28,830
But I can't tell her
anything back.

240
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:30,900
Should I leave things
the way they are?

241
00:22:30,906 --> 00:22:33,730
Don't ask me those things.

242
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:35,830
You're cold, Manager.

243
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:41,370
Welcome.

244
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:46,240
Who's that customer?

245
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:49,800
Don't you know him?

246
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,300
No.

247
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:53,880
Welcome!

248
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,450
Welcome, Dr. Asami.

249
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,550
Did that call bother you?

250
00:23:08,557 --> 00:23:09,720
Not really.

251
00:23:09,727 --> 00:23:11,690
You don't normally come
during lunch hours.

252
00:23:11,693 --> 00:23:14,160
I had a complex surgery
this morning.

253
00:23:14,163 --> 00:23:16,047
So I had a craving
to eat beef.

254
00:23:16,047 --> 00:23:18,240
That girl there, is
Shinpei's daughter.

255
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:20,940
She's working here
part-time from today.

256
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,850
She looks like a nice girl.

257
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,510
Is she really his daughter?

258
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:29,480
She must've taken
after her mother.

259
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:31,890
True.

260
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:33,940
Does it bother you, after all?

261
00:23:33,946 --> 00:23:35,190
Why should it?

262
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:37,760
Did it sway you feelings?

263
00:23:37,767 --> 00:23:39,360
You're awful.

264
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,300
Dr. Asami is here for lunch.

265
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,040
It's hot!

266
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:57,750
All the customers are gone.

267
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,120
Let's eat!

268
00:24:00,126 --> 00:24:01,840
<i>Itadakimasu!</i>

269
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,320
Eat up!

270
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:08,160
I want to eat, too!

271
00:24:08,167 --> 00:24:10,260
I'm deducting it
from your pay!

272
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:13,960
Those three work elsewhere
during the mornings and

273
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:16,230
come to our lessons
during the afternoons.

274
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:19,000
Didn't you see us
practicing yesterday?

275
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,670
This place turns into
a show pub at nights.

276
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:24,810
We are rising stars.

277
00:24:24,813 --> 00:24:27,080
That's so cool!

278
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,380
Think so?

279
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,780
Do you dance, too?

280
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:35,450
Don't I look like I do?

281
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:37,420
Well...

282
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:39,440
Don't say it.

283
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,960
I'll keep working at it.

284
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:46,000
Marimo, can you dance?

285
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,750
Dance with us.
I can teach you.

286
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:50,300
I can't dance. I really can't.

287
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:56,340
Deliver these
to Konari-san's office.

288
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:00,310
Who's Konari-san?

289
00:25:00,310 --> 00:25:01,700
Our attorney.

290
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:04,210
We pay his retainer fees
with our <i>bentô</i>.

291
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,600
I'm here with the <i>bentô</i>!

292
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:39,770
Please leave them there.

293
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,150
Are you working hard?

294
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:50,020
Is she your kid?

295
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,300
Kid?

296
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:54,250
She's cute!

297
00:25:54,250 --> 00:25:56,360
So she's the one.

298
00:25:57,020 --> 00:26:00,090
I pity you for having
a father like him.

299
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:02,200
Get back to work.

300
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,080
Be sure to take care of her.

301
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,740
You have to, by law.

302
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:09,200
It's your duty to provide her
with a home and education.

303
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:11,500
Satoi.

304
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:20,950
Are you Marimo-chan?

305
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:30,190
Feel free to come to me
for help any time.

306
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:41,930
Hey!

307
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,070
Don't ever talk to that
stupid Satoi again.

308
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:49,100
He's dumb, but he likes
to talk about education

309
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:50,800
and social status.

310
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:53,210
He should come to terms
with his stupidity.

311
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,610
What do you do there?

312
00:26:56,140 --> 00:26:57,480
Work.

313
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:00,080
Aren't you a private eye?

314
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:04,620
You're too naive!

315
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:09,490
The attorneys need
someone like me.

316
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:13,690
In fact, I'm the one who
supports their livelihood.

317
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:17,060
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

318
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:18,920
I wonder about that.

319
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,500
It's true. Very true.

320
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:30,140
Stop crying.

321
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:31,880
I'm sorry.

322
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:55,560
Come here.

323
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:59,400
Come here!

324
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:03,570
I said to come here!

325
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:06,800
What? Is she ordering
me around?

326
00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:15,580
So you're Shinpei-chan's daughter.

327
00:28:17,650 --> 00:28:19,450
I'm having a hard time
believing it, too.

328
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:22,650
I see. Is that right?

329
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,490
Is that good?

330
00:28:24,490 --> 00:28:25,690
Yes.

331
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:28,790
I see, I see, I see.

332
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:33,330
What is he like?

333
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:38,930
You don't refer to him
as your papa?

334
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:42,670
Oh, I see. I don't blame you.

335
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:45,670
It's hard to call him papa
out of the blue.

336
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,600
I see.

337
00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:55,580
I think he's a good man.

338
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:58,770
I like his character.

339
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:00,667
He must really love people.

340
00:29:00,667 --> 00:29:02,960
He's hungry for family love.

341
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:06,400
He lost his mother and
siblings in an auto accident.

342
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:08,760
What do you call it?

343
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:13,400
I think it's that... that...
What do you call it?

344
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:40,850
You're not aiming right.

345
00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:13,770
He's truly aggravating.

346
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,800
Shinpei!

347
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,650
What's the favor
you want to ask me?

348
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:49,620
Will you use your
charms to seduce him?

349
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,290
He looks earnest.

350
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:54,430
He looks delicious.

351
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,270
You don't want to be seen.

352
00:31:10,050 --> 00:31:14,850
Don't forget to collect
5,000 or 10,000 yen from him.

353
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:18,450
Is it only for 5,000 yen?

354
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:23,360
No. I'll reward you
generously later.

355
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:27,530
Don't take photos of
my face with that.

356
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,900
Hello.

357
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,000
Yes?

358
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:45,680
This is the sign.

359
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:52,650
What a relief. You look
like an earnest person.

360
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:55,290
Excuse me, but...

361
00:31:55,297 --> 00:31:56,720
Who's that?

362
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:00,660
How about this much?

363
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:07,060
As I said on the phone,
please help me financially.

364
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:19,080
20,000 yen?

365
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:23,110
She's a real hooker.

366
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:25,280
I don't believe this!

367
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,300
They're here.

368
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:52,970
This is the place.

369
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,970
Let's go in.

370
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:01,640
Go in!

371
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,820
Don't worry.

372
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:19,160
Would you like to do
a part-time job?

373
00:33:43,890 --> 00:33:45,639
I'm home!

374
00:33:45,639 --> 00:33:47,660
I need to get her name...

375
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:50,160
It's Sakuragi Erika-chan.

376
00:33:51,430 --> 00:33:53,060
She's a very bad girl.

377
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,500
Hi.

378
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:08,110
You're in a good mood.

379
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:12,340
You're giving me the creeps.

380
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:18,480
Didn't you call me
a good-for-nothing?

381
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:22,720
Shall I treat you
to something?

382
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:26,790
Do you want to eat
<i>sukiyaki</i> or <i>shabu-shabu</i>?

383
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,400
Old man Konari is going
to pay me well for these.

384
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:40,300
How did you get these?

385
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:42,540
She did something bad.

386
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:44,140
Paid companionship.

387
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:46,680
Give them back to me.

388
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:47,900
Hey, wait!

389
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:50,130
What are you going
to do with them?

390
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:51,630
Beats me.

391
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:53,310
What kind of answer
is that?

392
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:54,750
This is my job.

393
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:57,320
The rest will be up
to old man Konari.

394
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:59,960
Do you need those
photos for the trail?

395
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,160
Of course.

396
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:04,000
Shinpei!

397
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:06,830
I found out her name.

398
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:12,040
Did you find out which
school she attends?

399
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,200
Yes, I did.

400
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,070
She's a high school student.

401
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:22,460
Cheese!

402
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:24,390
Knock before you come in!

403
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:28,000
- Stop getting jittery.
- He has a small penis.

404
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,600
Stop being vulgar.
What do you want?

405
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:35,610
- The job's done.
- Is that true?

406
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:38,150
- See for yourself.
- He's going into a hotel.

407
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:40,593
- Who is this woman?
- A paid companion.

408
00:36:40,593 --> 00:36:43,166
If you blackmail him with
this, he'll back down.

409
00:36:43,166 --> 00:36:45,850
His wife is scary.

410
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:49,160
This is too good to be
true, coming from you.

411
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:50,540
That was uncalled-for.

412
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:54,030
If you're going to say that,
I can always tear them up.

413
00:36:55,730 --> 00:36:57,230
Stop it.

414
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,530
Just kidding!

415
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:04,180
Are you stupid? Why
would I tear them up?

416
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:06,040
They're going to
change into money.

417
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,000
Are you feeling jittery again?

418
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,060
Stop it.

419
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,030
I forgot to report this
to the Sensei.

420
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:20,600
What do you think of this?

421
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:31,210
A paid companion.

422
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:33,550
Perfect.

423
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:36,390
Wouldn't that
intimidate Tanigawa?

424
00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:39,340
Sakuragi Erika-chan, age 17.
A senior at Teito High School.

425
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:40,990
Is she a high school student?

426
00:37:40,990 --> 00:37:44,130
She's been doing it for
a while through a circle.

427
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:46,600
Her father is a Section
Chief of a major bank,

428
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:48,600
and her mother is a
full-time housewife.

429
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:51,100
This should get him
to back down.

430
00:37:52,670 --> 00:37:55,820
Can I get paid for it?

431
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:57,000
Stop it.

432
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:02,140
So this is your job...

433
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:05,680
This is what you
do for a living.

434
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:08,560
What're you getting at?

435
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,890
You investigate on the
person's private lifestyle

436
00:38:10,890 --> 00:38:12,760
and you make
a living off of that.

437
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:15,020
Is that what you were
going to treat me with?

438
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:20,880
I'm sorry. She's still a kid.

439
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,303
Why didn't you stop the
crime before it happened?

440
00:38:23,303 --> 00:38:24,850
What?

441
00:38:24,850 --> 00:38:27,110
She went to the hotel
with a stranger.

442
00:38:27,110 --> 00:38:29,820
If he was a whacko,
she could've been killed.

443
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:31,820
So why didn't you stop
them before they went in?

444
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:34,350
Is she your friend?

445
00:38:34,350 --> 00:38:36,310
She has nothing
to do with us.

446
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:39,190
Nothing to do with you?

447
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:42,060
That's right. I just
did my job.

448
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:44,060
It doesn't matter to me
what happens to the person.

449
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:46,060
Oh yes, it does! You
were there watching it!

450
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:49,000
What have I done that
deserves your criticism?

451
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,600
- Am I wrong?
- You're not wrong at all.

452
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:55,050
It's your friend and that
man that are wrong.

453
00:38:55,050 --> 00:38:57,290
If you have time to take
photos, then stop them.

454
00:38:57,290 --> 00:38:58,730
Why should I?

455
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:02,770
A woman who wants money.
A man who buys her with money.

456
00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:04,450
They're both doing it
at their free will.

457
00:39:04,450 --> 00:39:06,540
They're in agreement
with each other.

458
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:09,740
It's not my business
if Tanigawa kills Erika.

459
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:14,320
You're the worst.

460
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,920
You know...

461
00:39:23,990 --> 00:39:25,930
What do you think
you're doing!?

462
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,400
Now you've got me mad!

463
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:39,770
Don't show up out of the
blue and criticize my work!

464
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:43,280
You're an eyesore!

465
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:49,350
Screw you!

466
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:12,100
Hey!

467
00:40:25,410 --> 00:40:27,380
Don't have
expectations of me.

468
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:34,750
I'm not like that.

469
00:40:59,610 --> 00:41:02,180
There's always "that"
possibility for a girl.

470
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:14,830
A child like me, who didn't
know of her papa, can be born.

471
00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:32,410
You're a scum to society.

472
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,070
This guarantees our
victory in the lawsuit.

473
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,600
This is the pay for this
job. Give it to Shinpei.

474
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,110
Don't show such a sad smile.

475
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:24,780
Shinpei! We got paid!

476
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:27,450
She's so immature.

477
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:30,620
Deliver the negatives
and photos later.

478
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:33,110
You know...

479
00:42:33,110 --> 00:42:34,690
I'm not increasing the pay.

480
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,860
I'm dropping out of this one.

481
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:43,540
What are you saying?
Are you stupid?

482
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,040
Don't be fettered by her.

483
00:42:48,070 --> 00:42:50,080
This is a lucrative job.

484
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:53,750
You get paid this much
for two days of work.

485
00:42:53,750 --> 00:42:55,600
400,000 yen for two days!

486
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:56,980
Isn't that a great job?

487
00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:01,290
I don't like the way
you put it.

488
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:25,370
<i>She's very naive.</i>

489
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:30,180
<i>She's exactly like Yukino-chan.</i>

490
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:32,580
<i>Yukino?</i>

491
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:35,580
<i>Marimo's mother.</i>

492
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:40,340
<i>She was a caring and
righteous person.</i>

493
00:43:40,344 --> 00:43:41,750
<i>Did you know her?</i>

494
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:47,160
<i>I defended him eight times
as a public prosecutor and</i>

495
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:49,700
six times after
I went on my own.

496
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:52,770
He's the worst.

497
00:43:52,776 --> 00:43:55,470
They were all for self-defense.

498
00:43:58,370 --> 00:44:02,270
He's running hard for
the sake of others.

499
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:09,350
In the last case
I defended him in...

500
00:44:09,350 --> 00:44:13,750
He tried to save a guy that
was picked on in town.

501
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:17,730
The guy was a total stranger.

502
00:44:17,736 --> 00:44:19,590
It's not normal, right?

503
00:44:22,190 --> 00:44:25,830
That night, at the hospital
he was rushed to,

504
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:28,730
he met with Yukino-chan.

505
00:44:40,610 --> 00:44:44,680
He's not legally bound to
take care of Marimo, but

506
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:48,650
Yukino-chan entrusted Marimo
in Shinpei's care.

507
00:44:49,890 --> 00:44:53,130
Her dearly beloved daughter.

508
00:44:54,030 --> 00:44:56,500
So they aren't real
father and daughter?

509
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:10,300
I wonder if he'll change...

510
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:13,700
...after meeting Marimo.

511
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:48,350
What's wrong?

512
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:51,520
Satoi-san gave me this.

513
00:47:57,690 --> 00:47:59,990
These are the
negatives and photos.

514
00:48:05,430 --> 00:48:07,970
Please be sure to win
against that Tanigawa guy.

515
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:10,200
See you later.

516
00:48:15,610 --> 00:48:17,340
What are you doing?

517
00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:27,390
You don't get paid for it.

518
00:48:28,390 --> 00:48:30,660
You didn't do any work.

519
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:37,270
It was premature work.

520
00:48:37,270 --> 00:48:39,600
So I won't pay you for it.

521
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,600
Shinpei.

522
00:48:54,550 --> 00:48:58,150
What were those tears
for anyway?

523
00:49:01,360 --> 00:49:03,560
Respond to her feelings.

524
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:38,400
<i>Mama... why did you
leave me alone?</i>

525
00:49:55,530 --> 00:49:57,260
I searched all over for you!

526
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:01,770
What is it?

527
00:50:06,370 --> 00:50:08,610
I lost my pay because of you.

528
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:22,320
I'll be straight with you!

529
00:51:23,850 --> 00:51:25,990
I'm not registering you
as my daughter!

530
00:51:25,990 --> 00:51:27,290
What?

531
00:51:29,190 --> 00:51:31,120
I'm not registering you!

532
00:51:31,490 --> 00:51:33,090
What was that?

533
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:37,830
And I don't have money!

534
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:40,670
I can't hear you!

535
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:15,360
You're kidding, right?

536
00:52:16,730 --> 00:52:18,530
I'm serious. Come.

537
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:33,570
I'm going to scream!

538
00:52:38,180 --> 00:52:40,080
Your friend is in this room.

539
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:43,350
What?

540
00:52:43,850 --> 00:52:45,620
Fools like her don't learn.

541
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:50,490
I'll only help this once.

542
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:59,500
Hello? Shall we get to it?

543
00:53:05,370 --> 00:53:07,010
Let's have fun already.

544
00:53:13,310 --> 00:53:15,050
Stop right there.

545
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:17,370
Who are you people?

546
00:53:17,370 --> 00:53:18,750
Are you a pervert?

547
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:22,120
Will you get it going
with her?

548
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:24,200
I'm going all out today.

549
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:25,790
I'm ready to shoot.

550
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:27,300
No!

551
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:29,400
Don't give us that.

552
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:32,230
This is what happens
when you get carried away.

553
00:53:38,670 --> 00:53:40,010
Erika.

554
00:53:52,650 --> 00:53:54,320
I forgot something.

555
00:54:00,030 --> 00:54:02,130
Who were those people?

556
00:54:09,370 --> 00:54:11,170
This is for your lesson fee.

557
00:54:14,610 --> 00:54:16,180
You're the worst.

558
00:54:18,250 --> 00:54:21,150
Try resolving it on
your own the next time.

559
00:54:24,020 --> 00:54:26,320
Talk is cheap.

560
00:54:55,200 --> 00:55:00,640
<i>Mama, I want to know...</i>

561
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:03,500
<i>...the other world that
I don't know of.</i>

562
00:55:04,770 --> 00:55:08,180
<i>I want to know the world
of the man you loved.</i>

563
00:55:24,050 --> 00:55:25,350
Welcome.

564
00:55:25,820 --> 00:55:27,120
Is Shinpei here?

565
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:28,520
He's over there.

566
00:55:29,350 --> 00:55:31,220
The show is about to start.

567
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:37,000
We've been waiting for this!

568
00:55:56,230 --> 00:55:58,570
Welcome, everyone!

569
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:05,410
It's show time again!

570
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:14,950
We're striving for tomorrow!

571
00:56:59,140 --> 00:57:00,843
Ouch!

572
00:57:00,843 --> 00:57:02,410
Let's make up with a toast.

573
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:04,540
I'm still a high schooler.

574
00:57:04,940 --> 00:57:06,860
This is summer break.

575
00:57:06,866 --> 00:57:08,710
What kind of parent are you?

576
00:57:09,310 --> 00:57:10,610
That hurts!

577
00:57:23,890 --> 00:57:26,860
When I was on the back
of your bike the other time...

578
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:28,400
What were you saying?

579
00:57:31,540 --> 00:57:32,970
I said it hurts!

580
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:35,800
You were clinging close
to me, so I was wondering

581
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:38,200
- if you had any boobs.
- Don't call it boobs!

582
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:39,640
Don't touch me!

583
00:57:40,210 --> 00:57:41,650
That hurts!

584
00:57:41,650 --> 00:57:43,780
Stop!

585
00:57:47,490 --> 00:57:49,020
I'm with the police.

586
00:57:49,420 --> 00:57:50,950
Aren't you a high schooler?

587
00:57:50,953 --> 00:57:52,560
For one, you shouldn't
be drinking beer.

588
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:53,850
But how are you two related?

589
00:57:53,850 --> 00:57:55,830
Can you come with me
to the police station?

590
00:57:55,830 --> 00:57:57,460
It won't take very long.

591

summer had started.</i>
