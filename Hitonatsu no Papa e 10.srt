1
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:09,770
Summer... will be
over soon.

2
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:15,340
What was I doing
this summer?

3
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:22,380
<i>My mama died, so I went
to live with "him".</i>

4
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:25,650
<i>We fought a lot.</i>

5
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:29,990
<i>I kissed Rintarô-senpai.</i>

6
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:36,270
Thanks.

7
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:44,940
Your dad is cool.
He's young at heart.

8
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,880
I envy you, Marimo.

9
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:54,020
I liked his dark side...
and his beard.

10
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:59,920
Rintarô-senpai seems to want to
see me to talk about him.

11
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:05,590
Is that right? So you're
not calling him "papa" yet.

12
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:15,300
You should. That would
make Shinpei happy.

13
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:20,040
I don't like it. Everyone
brings "him" up.

14
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:24,920
- Watch the house today.
- Are you going somewhere?

15
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,460
I'm going to the onsen.

16
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,690
I'm going to use that
overnight trip for two

17
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:32,890
- to the onsen with Asami.
- You said you'd take me.

18
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:36,390
- I'm taking Asami.
- You said you'd take me!

19
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,100
See you!

20
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,600
Liar.

21
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:49,670
I don't care about you.

22
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:01,980
What is it?

23
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,660
Shinpei... died.

24
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:15,390
His motorcycle
was totaled.

25
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:18,030
There was no way he
could've survived that.

26
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:23,460
He said he was going
to take you, after all.

27
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:25,610
So he turned back.

28
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:38,450
I see. So you are
crying. Are you sad?

29
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,260
Why didn't you
call him "papa"?

30
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:51,830
He was working his
hardest after he took you in.

31
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:55,100
Yet you...

32
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:59,310
Shinpei won't find peace.

33
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:04,380
But...

34
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:18,190
Did I cry?

35
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,270
Did I cry for him?

36
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:28,140
No way.

37
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:36,980
- Good morning!
- You're full of spirit!

38
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:40,770
I dreamed that I got the part
for the Muscle Museum!

39
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:44,520
- Oh, really?
- You and I passed.

40
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:48,420
Did I pass it, too?
It'll come true then!

41
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,900
A dream-come-true?

42
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:04,110
A dream-come-true,
huh. No way.

00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,500
Marimo-chan, what's that?

59
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Hello.

60
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:31,300
I see. So you're worried
about Shinpei.

61
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,300
So you're being a good
daughter to him.

62
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:39,030
Have you called
him "that"?

63
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:43,030
- What's "that"?
- Papa.

64
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:45,950
Have you called
him "papa"?

65
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:49,980
Are you still referring
to him as just "him"?

66
00:06:50,550 --> 00:06:55,320
You should call him "papa."
It'll make him happy.

67
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,590
I saw this scene
in my dream.

00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:11,700
Marimo-chan!

70
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:17,100
Isn't today the day they're
announcing the audition results?

71
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,580
I wonder if I passed. I've
been excited since this morning.

72
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:20,950
Why would you pass?

73
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:23,150
<i>Didn't I dance great
on center stage?</i>

74
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:26,420
- You were just in the way.
- I thought I danced pretty well.

75
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:31,960
Yes, I understand.
Thank you.

76
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:37,330
Who was that call from?

77
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:39,900
Is it for the Muscle
Museum musical?

78
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,500
Kôji, congratulations.

79
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,260
Did I pass?

80
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:49,260
- I did it!
- What about me?

81
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:52,980
Ponta, Chôko, and
Kikugorô also passed.

82
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:56,180
We did it!

83
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,620
What about me?

84
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,650
What are you
talking about?

85
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:14,230
Try harder next time.

86
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:24,080
- Four out of seven passed!
- That's awesome!

87
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:29,380
You'll all become stars.

88
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:34,450
Don't forget us now.

89
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:38,020
I'll go see it with my
co-workers at the station.

90
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:42,430
Wait, Jun!

91
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:47,560
Don't sulk like that!
This isn't your last chance!

92
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,440
I know that!

93
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,970
Then congratulate the
ones that have passed.

94
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:54,510
Isn't that friendship?

95
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:57,680
I'm hungry so I'm going
out to eat a beef bowl.

96
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,480
They're hopeless.

97
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:07,190
Think so?

98
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:10,360
They're just frustrated.

99
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,330
The three of us failed.

100
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:16,400
But that's the result.

101
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:21,670
If you sulk, then they
can't be openly happy.

102
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:23,540
I know that.

103
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:26,470
Then you should...

104
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:29,940
Shinpei, you're cold.

105
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:36,450
That was an awful
thing to say.

106
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:40,220
I thought you understood
the pains of others.

107
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:55,130
Marimo-chan, what's wrong?

108
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:02,340
I see. That's harsh.

109
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,380
How can he say that
to the people who failed?

110
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:12,790
That was mean. I feel
disappointed in him.

111
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:16,920
Is Shinpei at fault?

112
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:23,960
Do you think he would
say such a mean thing?

113
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:30,400
I think he was just trying
to encourage them.

114
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:37,010
And to tell them to be happy
for their friends' success.

115
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:40,250
He wants them
to strive harder.

116
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,750
He should just say that.

117
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:48,850
He's a man of few words.

118
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:13,080
Where did he go? I want
to apologize to him.

119
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:19,180
I was busy looking
all over for that cat today.

120
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:23,020
- I feel hungry.
- Sorry about earlier.

121
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:28,860
I don't think you're
wrong in what you said.

122
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:33,270
So don't let it get to you.

123
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:36,200
Are you trying
to cheer me up?

124
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,510
So you have
a sweet side to you.

125
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:43,410
Stop kissing me,
you pervert.

126
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:44,910
You're hurting me!

127
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:59,450
- Make me something.
- We only have leftovers.

128
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:01,690
Will you make me
something? I'm famished.

129
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:08,300
Excuse me. It's time
for us to close.

130
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:13,340
- They can stay.
- OK.

131
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:15,870
They'll be working
here from next week.

132
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:20,450
- Can we look around?
- Sure.

133
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:27,020
I wanted them to check out
the pub's atmosphere today.

134
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:28,950
So they're scouting.
the place.

135
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,970
What do you mean by
they're going to work here?

136
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:35,800
They're replacing Kikugorô,
Ponta, Kôji and Chôko.

137
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,700
Are they going to quit?

138
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:41,300
I said nothing
about quitting.

139
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:45,770
- That's a mean joke!
- That's not funny at all!

140
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:51,340
Are you taking the
stage practice lightly?

141
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:54,180
How many days do you
think you'll be practicing?

142
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:56,210
Two months!

143
00:12:56,210 --> 00:12:58,750
You'll be practicing hard
for two months straight,

144
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,620
day in and day out!

145
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:02,960
You didn't have time to be
dancing here, in between.

146
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,020
Wait a minute, Manager!

147
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:06,510
I'm going to lose
four people.

148
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:07,960
I have to find
replacements.

149
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:11,110
- I'll work both sides.
- Get realistic!

150
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:13,800
I'm running
a business here.

151
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:17,940
I can't let a tired
person up on stage.

152
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,240
It's rude to
the customers!

153
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:27,780
It's time to say goodbye.

154
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:45,170
I don't want to leave here.

155
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:53,740
Here's the key. Be sure
to lock up after you.

156
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:56,550
Manager!

157
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:05,360
Kikugorô, you've
stepped up the ladder.

158
00:14:07,090 --> 00:14:11,800
But... I never thought
about leaving here.

159
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:17,540
What is your dream?
To work here?

160
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:19,870
That's no it, is it?

161
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:23,540
Isn't it your dream to
dance on a huge stage?

162
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:28,880
If you think of this place as
someplace you can fall back on,

163
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,650
then it's over for you.

164
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:34,500
I'm the only person who
can always stay here.

165
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:38,220
The rest of you have
to leave here someday.

166
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:42,860
That's true.

167
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:51,870
I'll try hard to graduate from
here as soon as possible.

168
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,870
I think I'll be first.

169
00:14:56,080 --> 00:15:00,680
Kikugorô, we'll
come after you.

170
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:04,450
We'll get a part in a
different stage production.

171
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:10,950
So as graduates of this
pub, live proud to our name.

172
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,390
We don't want this place
to have a bad reputation.

173
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:28,310
When you get famous...

174
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:34,380
Be sure to advertise
this place.

175
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:37,920
Then we'll get a lot
of customers.

176
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:44,420
- Manager...
- Stop crying.

177
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:24,340
The manager is nice.

178
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:29,340
When your pursue
your dreams...

179
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:31,780
You have to go
through farewells, too.

180
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:37,020
What do I want to do?

181
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:40,590
Don't feel rushed.

182
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:47,130
Life is long.
Take it slowly.

183
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:53,730
Do you understand?

184
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,410
That hurts. Stop it.

185
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:08,110
Good morning.

186
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:10,803
Are you going
to school from today?

187
00:17:10,803 --> 00:17:12,120
Bye!

188
00:17:13,390 --> 00:17:15,763
A school uniform...

189
00:17:15,763 --> 00:17:18,260
It's been a long
time since I wore one.

190
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,370
If she's going to school...

191
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:35,510
- Delicious!
- I'm glad.

192
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:41,410
Why are you here though?

193
00:17:42,350 --> 00:17:44,890
I thought you might need
breakfast, since Marimo-chan

194
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:46,950
is going to school now.

195
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:49,020
Does school start today?

196
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:53,560
Is it just you and me?

197
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:08,910
It's not even noon yet.

198
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,490
Please have
something to drink.

199
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:23,690
Are you Marimo's
school teacher?

200
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,230
How embarrassing.

201
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,327
What is your
relationship to Marimo-san?

202
00:18:31,327 --> 00:18:33,670
I'm her father.

203
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,370
You have a different
surname from her.

204
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:39,770
There's a reason for that.

205
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:44,180
It's a problem to have
a young girl living in

206
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:46,250
an immoral
environment as this.

207
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:51,086
- Are you after her fortune?
- What?

208
00:18:51,086 --> 00:18:54,190
Are you after her mother's
insurance proceeds?

209
00:18:56,090 --> 00:18:57,960
This hag has got the nerve.

210
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:01,660
I'm going to bring this up
as a problem at school.

211
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:06,370
I'll just register her
as my daughter then.

212
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:08,040
It it wrong for me
to have a girlfriend?

213
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:10,840
- Let me go!
- What's with you?

214
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,806
Are you trying to get
between Marimo and me?

215
00:19:12,806 --> 00:19:14,240
Are you getting
violent with me?

216
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,940
You're hurting me!

217
00:19:16,310 --> 00:19:18,180
You're a failure
as a parent!

218
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:24,850
A failure?

219
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:28,090
Don't let that get to you.

220
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:33,403
I'm going.

221
00:19:33,403 --> 00:19:37,200
Hey! Don't go
to the school.

222
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,170
I'm going to the
ward office.

223
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:42,300
I'll register her
as my daughter.

224
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,600
I'm going.

225
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:51,240
Why? She's my daughter!

226
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:54,310
Not an adopted daughter!

227
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:57,080
I want to register her.

228
00:19:57,890 --> 00:20:00,890
Please submit evidence
that she's your daughter.

229
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:10,330
Sensei!

230
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:12,900
He's in a meeting right
now. You can't go in.

231
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:14,870
They're discussing
something important.

232
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:16,600
I'll just ask you.

233
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:19,167
I want to register
Marimo as my daughter.

234
00:20:19,167 --> 00:20:21,437
I don't know the
procedures to do it.

235
00:20:21,437 --> 00:20:25,310
Sensei! Please!
Please help me!

236
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:29,343
My advice to you as
a retained attorney is...

237
00:20:29,343 --> 00:20:32,990
You have no choice but
to close down that pub.

238
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:37,720
The owner is to
blame for it all.

239
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:42,930
You won't be able to give
them any severance pay,

240
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:45,570
but you can at least
pay them their wages.

241
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:50,300
But next month, when
the debtors put a lien on

242
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:54,070
everything, you won't be
able to pay them a cent.

243
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:56,610
If me work hard
this month...

244
00:20:56,610 --> 00:20:58,540
It's impossible.

245
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:05,590
The owner got
hooked on gambling.

246
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:12,490
So he borrowed money
using that pub as collateral.

247
00:21:13,830 --> 00:21:15,930
I'm at a loss now.

248
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:21,130
Things were just
starting to look bright.

249
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:31,610
With Kikugorô and the
others going out in the world...

250
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:36,080
We were starting to get
a steady crowd of customers.

251
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:40,450
We were covered by the media
as the place they trained at.

252
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,390
And...

253
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:56,040
I'm bummed.

254
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:03,580
Everyone worked
so hard at it.

255
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:17,504
Ten million yen.

256
00:22:17,504 --> 00:22:20,290
The loan is for
ten million yen?

257
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:26,000
There's nothing
you can do about it.

258
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:30,370
It's not something you
should get involved in.

259
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:32,170
But...

260
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:35,510
If that pub closes down...

261
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:37,776
Koba-san will lose his dream.

262
00:22:37,776 --> 00:22:41,330
It's not your duty
to look after his life.

263
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:45,250
He danced in front
of his daughter recently.

264
00:22:46,790 --> 00:22:50,120
<i>When I saw him dancing
passionately for his daughter...</i>

265
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:54,160
I wanted him to rise
victorious in life.

266
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,970
Rise victorious in life?

267
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:07,910
After working for you as
an investigator, I realized

268
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:11,540
that you have to win in
court or it means nothing.

269
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:14,170
If you don't win, then
you will end up a loser.

270
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:16,790
So to win, I did anything
and everything.

271
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:18,850
Even sleazy things.

272
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:26,400
Sotokoba should
live his own life.

273
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:31,370
You have to live
for Marimo-chan.

274
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:43,210
I can't ignore my
friend in distress.

275
00:23:59,030 --> 00:24:00,960
Where is it?

276
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:13,240
<i>Are you after her fortune?</i>

277
00:24:18,050 --> 00:24:21,340
So he was fooling around
with a woman in this room.

278
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:24,420
Do I have to keep a
constant eye on him?

279
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:29,690
What are you doing here?

280
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:34,270
He's not home.

281
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:36,700
Didn't second
semester start?

282
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:41,100
What are you going to do?
Go to college or go to work?

283
00:24:41,610 --> 00:24:44,100
Did you come
here for me?

284
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:46,940
Of course. I'm worried.

285
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:51,250
I haven't decided yet.

286
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,620
Why?

287
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:59,260
Before summer, I was
determined to go to college.

288
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:02,290
But now, I'm wondering if
there's any meaning to going

289
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:04,890
to college when I don't
know what I want out of life.

290
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:08,760
That's what I learned
from working there.

291
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:12,750
Everyone has a dream... and
is striving hard towards it.

292
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:16,940
That made me want to be
engrossed in something, too.

293
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:23,010
What do you want to do?

294
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:26,480
I don't know yet.

295
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:30,750
That sounds deep.

296
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:35,360
I met a lot of strange
people this summer.

297
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:39,260
That sounds nice.

298
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,570
You're great.

299
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:57,850
I feel like hugging
you tightly.

300
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:04,720
Shinpei-chan!

301
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:08,290
What were you doing?
What were you trying to do?

302
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:11,390
- Did you drag in a guy?
- It's not what you think!

303
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:18,330
What are you doing
behind her father's back!?

304
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:23,810
- Why are you here?
- I'm going to get fired.

305
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:26,980
My superior thinks I'm
working on the side.

306
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:28,910
Remember the time
I danced at the pub?

307
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:31,880
A civilian who saw that
reported it to my superior.

308
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:35,150
I said I wasn't working there,
but they wouldn't believe me.

309
00:26:35,150 --> 00:26:38,760
I have absolutely no
interest in dancing!

310
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:41,060
What do you mean?
You were really into it.

311
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:44,890
A big job?

312
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:49,910
- Are you out of money?
- That's right.

313
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:52,570
You're the only one
that I can turn to.

314
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:56,270
Refer me to someone who
will pay me ten million yen.

315
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:58,740
Ten million yen?

316
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:03,450
You have the right
contacts, don't you?

317
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:08,500
- Will this guy do?
- Yes, he'll do.

318
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Can we trust this
bearded guy to do it?

319
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,700
There's no one else!

320
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:22,900
If we succeed, we can
live it up in Thailand!

321
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:34,110
They want you to steal
Hokuto Kôsan's microchip.

322
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:38,810
- Am I going to be a thief?
- An industry spy.

323
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,960
They'll pay you five
million yen upfront,

324
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,190
and the rest when
the job is done.

325
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,900
If you tell anyone,
we'll kill you.

326
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:21,830
Will you hear me out?
I don't know what to do.

327
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:24,260
Sorry, but I'm going
to be busy from now.

328
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:26,130
Where's the flashlight?

329
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,630
Do you know where
the flashlight is?

330
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:36,040
Did you touch this?

331
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:39,140
What were you
going to do with Mama's

332
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:41,040
insurance proceeds?

333
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,480
Well...

334
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:48,250
What's the big deal?
I only touched it.

335
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:50,850
You can use it.

336
00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:54,690
If you really need the
money, you can use it.

337
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:59,330
But I want to know what
you're going to use it for.

338
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,830
I want to know. Aren't
we father and daughter?

339
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:12,340
Well, it's for...

340
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:15,110
Asami-chan,
what are you doing?

341
00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:19,320
<i>If that pub closes down...</i>

342
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:22,020
<i>Koba-san will lose his dream.</i>

343
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,050
Marimo-chan, we're
about to open shortly.

344
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,530
Why do I have
to tell you?

345
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:31,190
I want to know.

346
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,430
- I just need the money!
- That doesn't tell me anything!

347
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:39,140
It's for our living expenses.

348
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:41,600
That's being cowardly
as a parent.

349
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,010
Stay out of this.

350
00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:46,710
I don't need to give a reason
to use my child's money.

351
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:49,340
Will you hand over those
insurance proceeds?

352
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:51,780
You said I could use it.

353
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:53,680
Will you lend it to me?

354
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:56,190
Why won't you tell
me the truth?

355
00:29:57,790 --> 00:30:02,460
Stop acting big in front
of me as a father.

356
00:30:03,690 --> 00:30:07,500
You don't show me
your true feelings.

357
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:13,300
I can't be a real
family with you.

358
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:18,270
Marimo-chan,
you've got it wrong.

359
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:22,780
He went to the ward
office today to register you

360
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:25,050
as his own daughter.

361
00:30:25,050 --> 00:30:26,650
Don't say
unnecessary things.

362
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:28,350
Register me?

363
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:33,060
Don't act on
your own like that.

364
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:35,890
What's with you?

365
00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:39,400
Don't decide such
important things on your own!

366
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,730
I am not one of your belongings!

367
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:46,270
I hate you.

368
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:50,240
Go ahead and use it,
if you want.

369
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:01,450
How lucky for me!

370
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:05,690
Shinpei, you're the worst.

371
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:09,090
If you use that money, you
will become a rotten person.

372
00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:10,830
Shinpei?

373
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:17,200
I know that.

374
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:27,440
Shinpei! What
happened? Tell me!

375
00:31:54,170 --> 00:31:56,740
He's like a child.

376
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:06,880
Konari-san.

377
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:09,990
Where's Shinpei?

378
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,120
He went out.

379
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:31,070
Will you give this to him?

380
00:32:31,810 --> 00:32:33,580
What is it for?

381
00:32:36,350 --> 00:32:43,020
It's the money
for your dream.

382
00:32:55,670 --> 00:32:59,400
Shinpei, I turned that deal
down and returned the money.

383
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:04,970
It sounds too dangerous,
no matter how I look at it.

384
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:08,610
Where's Shinpei?

385
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:15,150
Oh, no! What am
I going to do?

386
00:33:15,150 --> 00:33:19,490
- Did Shinpei go? Stop him!
- What's going on?

387
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:25,330
Tell me what's going on.
Where did Shinpei go?

388
00:33:32,670 --> 00:33:34,170
<i>See you!</i>

389
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:39,740
<i>I hate you.</i>

390
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:55,490
<i>Well, it's for...</i>

391
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,370
If you don't talk to me,
how am I supposed to know!

392
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,110
Marimo-chan...

393
00:34:54,250 --> 00:34:56,620
Shinpei is...

394
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:22,740
- What is his condition?
- We're still treating him.

395
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:28,910
What's going on?

396
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:34,050
I just came from the site!
His motorcycle was totaled.

397
00:35:34,690 --> 00:35:37,390
There's no way he
can survive that!

398
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:40,690
It's my fault.

399
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:44,960
No, it's not. It's my fault.

400
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:48,270
Will you be quiet?
We're in a hospital.

401
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:53,140
His pulse isn't coming back.

402
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,570
I'm a doctor. Please let
me go inside and watch.

403
00:36:02,050 --> 00:36:06,360
Please put this
somewhere on his body.

404
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:08,550
Please save him.

405
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:12,460
I'll hold on to it.

406
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:27,630
<i>My daughter?
Are you serious?</i>

407
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:29,110
<i>That's a harsh joke!</i>

408
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:31,880
<i>- Are you going to take it?
- You told me to take it.</i>

409
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:34,510
<i>- That's my entire fortune!
- You told me to take it.</i>

410
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:37,250
<i>Don't do to others what you
don't want done to you. Stupid.</i>

411
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,820
<i>Will you lock the door!</i>

412
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:55,130
<i>Marimo, you were
conceived with all of our love.</i>

413
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:01,200
<i>Please believe me.
I really didn't do it.</i>

414
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:03,640
<i>I can swear to you!</i>

415
00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:08,480
<i>Why did you
hurt my Marimo!?</i>

416
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:11,030
<i>It'll heal right away.</i>

417
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:13,870
<i>One gets irate
when one is hungry.</i>

418
00:37:13,870 --> 00:37:16,020
<i>Don't hold back and eat.</i>

419
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:21,930
Take me to
someplace fancier.

420
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:36,870
How old do you
think you are?

421
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:49,720
<i>What's so good about
an ordinary life?</i>

422
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:52,960
<i>It's rough being a parent.</i>

423
00:37:54,590 --> 00:37:56,360
Be my parent.

424
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:20,550
Don't leave me alone.

425
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:27,760
Don't leave me alone!
Don't die!

426
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:32,030
I don't want to be alone!

427
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:36,500
After Mama died...

428
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:39,070
All my relatives rejected me.

429
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:42,110
<i>But you took me in.</i>

430
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:45,080
That made me happy...
very happy!

431
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:50,180
I felt I wasn't alone anymore.

432
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:53,120
That feeling made me
very happy.

433
00:38:54,850 --> 00:38:57,290
I've been enjoying it lately.

434
00:38:57,290 --> 00:39:00,160
<i>I've been enjoying
spending time with you.</i>

435
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,760
So I don't want to be
alone anymore!

436
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:10,430
Live... for me!

437
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:18,980
I have a lot to apologize
to you about.

438
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:24,050
I haven't called you "papa" yet.

439
00:39:24,950 --> 00:39:28,950
So please...

440
00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:37,990
Shinpei, come back.

441
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:42,230
Shinpei!

442
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:47,970
Shinpei!

443
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,500
WE'RE HAVING A FAREWELL
AND SEND-OFF PARTY TODAY

444
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:21,140
Thank you for coming
when you're busy.

445
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,450
- Satoi-san.
- Why did Shinpei...

446
00:40:45,830 --> 00:40:48,490
Satoi, what're you
doing here?

447
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:52,540
When I think about Marimo-chan,
who is left all alone...

448
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:56,730
I don't know what to say.
Hey, Shinpei is here.

449
00:40:56,730 --> 00:40:59,510
Yes, he's here. He was
discharged today.

450
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:02,980
Discharged? What is
this send-off party for?

451
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:05,410
Aren't they overdoing it?

452
00:41:05,410 --> 00:41:07,720
They should be celebrating
my hospital discharge.

453
00:41:09,290 --> 00:41:13,190
- Hey!
- It's the loser!

454
00:41:13,190 --> 00:41:16,460
What's going on?
I thought you died.

455
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:19,200
Why are you alive?
Why am I here?

456
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,360
I'm immortal.

457
00:41:22,170 --> 00:41:23,970
Stop joking around.

458
00:41:23,970 --> 00:41:27,900
Satoi, I got to see you again!
That makes me so happy!

459
00:41:28,210 --> 00:41:30,470
Congratulations on your
hospital discharge.

460
00:41:30,470 --> 00:41:34,410
How considerate of you!
A onsen trip for two!

461
00:41:34,410 --> 00:41:36,180
Isn't this the one
I bought before?

462
00:41:36,180 --> 00:41:37,750
Go with Asami-san.

463
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:42,150
- What a kid.
- I feel bad.

464
00:41:42,950 --> 00:41:45,800
So you've grown up.

465
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:48,120
Don't you have something
else to say to him?

466
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,840
Remember what
you said that day?

467
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:54,470
- Forget that.
- What is it?

468
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:56,370
- Go ahead and say it.
- Come out with it.

469
00:41:56,370 --> 00:42:00,870
- Now is your chance.
- What is it? Tell me.

470
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:07,310
Are you all having
nice dreams?

471
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:12,680
This is a send-off party
for the four who will be

472
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:14,520
turning their dreams
into reality.

473
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:18,970
But this won't be farewell.
This is just their departure!

474
00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:22,790
And this will be their last
stage performance here!

475
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:29,530
Dreams are there
to be realized.

476
00:42:30,870 --> 00:42:33,540
Let's dance till we drop!

477
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:53,820
Congratulations on your
hospital discharge, Papa.

478
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:56,960
So you said it.

479
00:42:58,730 --> 00:43:01,200
I didn't hear it too well.
Can you say it again?

480
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,400
No.

481
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:46,110
I found a dream.

482
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:50,650
I'm going to be a nurse,
just like my mama.

483
00:43:51,850 --> 00:43:54,350
Come and work for me then.

00:44:41,770 --> 00:44:44,000
<i>I found a dream for myself.</i>

486
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:48,170
<i>I am leaving this place today.</i>

487
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:56,050
Are you going to be
lonely without me?

488
00:44:57,210 --> 00:44:59,280
It'll be a big relief.

489
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:02,590
Likewise.

490
00:45:03,290 --> 00:45:07,600
Can a spoiled brat like
you survive in a dorm?

491
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:09,390
Oh, be quiet.

492
00:45:09,390 --> 00:45:14,060
You can still
change your mind.

493
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:20,370
I'll make my
dream come true.

494
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:29,280
Thanks for all
you've done.

495
00:45:32,650 --> 00:45:34,420
See you.

496
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:47,100
<i>My summer is about
to come an end.</i>

497
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:51,000
<i>With all that's happened,
I had the best summer ever.</i>

498
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:57,500
<i>That's because
I met you, Papa.</i>
